      <description>Each year I make up a list the week before Blackhat and Def Con of talks that I &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t miss&amp;rdquo; and some that I want to see (and use it for video watching afterwards for those I missed). This year I thought I would share that list here. I will be breaking them down by each day of the events by time slot. Any talk I have a :star2: by, is a &amp;ldquo;Must see&amp;rdquo; for me.</description>
