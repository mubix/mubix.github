    <description><![CDATA[World Password Day (who knew that was a thing?) is upon us. It is the first Thursday of May every year, and that falls on May 6th this year.
I&rsquo;m not sure how to start this blog post, but the meat of what I want to get into is password security and the evolution over the years.
In the 1900s (&hellip; yes people are saying that now&hellip; feel old yet?), password security was pretty simple.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[For brevity, I will be using the term &ldquo;partner&rdquo; to refer to the customer, Defensive Team, IT Team, or other direct consumers of the Offensive Team&rsquo;s output.
In my experience, offensive security teams, be them internal or external (consultants/contractors), the relationship they have with companies falls into one of four phases: The &ldquo;Adversarial&rdquo; phase The &ldquo;Hammer&rdquo; phase The &ldquo;Friendship&rdquo; phase The &ldquo;Adversarial Friendship&rdquo; phase
Adversarial The first phase is that of adversaries.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[For nearly a year I left a CoinHive miner up on the blog so that people that didn&rsquo;t feel like or couldn&rsquo;t afford a way to support the blog could do so via a bit of CPU power. Unfortunately during that time lots of malware started to use services like coinhive and I quickly started recieving warning that my site had been &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; or was showing up as malicious (har har).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Time is a one-time non-renewable precious resource you are given. It is ok to be greedy, selective, and even snobbish about how, and with whom you spend it.
If it helps, think of your time as a vault, money is withdrawn at a constant rate by people as you spend it, but you are not allowed to look inside to see how much you have left. It could be a billion dollars, it could be .]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I recently took the plunge and joined a startup called R5 Industries. I wanted to say thanks for all the well wishes that I received on social media. It has certainly calmed my nerves about the choice ;-).
I&rsquo;ve had a number of people ask what R5 Industries does. Our primary selling point is AntigenC2, which is a really Command and Control detection product (no agents). But we also do Red Team assessments and some other fun toys if you are interested, contact@r5industries.]]></description>

    <guid>https://malicious.link/posts/2015/hacking-advice-for-krystropolis/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[Today I was asked by @Krystropolis for a &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and maybe some hacking advice, see tweet:
I thought about it on my entire 1 hour drive home from just turning in my badge and laptop from a big corporation to go work at a start up. I thought about talking about ethics and data handling, to Geo-politics. I mean, what kind of hacking are we talking about.
I finally ended up thinking about what would have been the best advice for me, growing up, for &ldquo;how to learn hacking&rdquo;, and I boiled it down right before I pulled into my drive way to two words: &ldquo;Build It&rdquo;.]]></description>

I didn&rsquo;t know Aaron Swartz, or even 1% of what he was doing in the world to make it a better place and for that I am ashamed. I will do better, to look around, see what needs to be changed in this world and make it a reality.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Let me start off by saying this post is easy for me to write in one facet as I&rsquo;ve never been a heavy drinker or much enjoyed the taste of alcohol. So if you need a reason to disregard what I say next, I leave the door open.
I am still pretty much a runt in the infosec community as I didn&rsquo;t even begin learning computers (outside of playing games on them) until 2005.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So there is already an exploit: http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843
There are naysayers: http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/
And then there is the truth: http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html
I like the design of the tabs and address bar, but I can do that with a theme in firefox. I want my add-ons, even with the memory problems. Chrome is great for Mom and Pap, but for “Internet Power Users” it falls lightyears short on features. So where is the brass tax?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I recently was Stumbling and happened across the following video. Now, when people use StumbleUpon they are usually bored and aren’t really contributing to the world as we know it. It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.
My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”]]></description>

I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone.

    <description><![CDATA[Now, I don’t like to publicly bad mouth companies, but at some point, Comcast’s lack of “service” has got to stop. Well, let me rephrase that: Comcast needs to be held accountable for their utter lack of due diligence. I have been a Comcast customer by default ever since they swallowed the portion of Adelphia that held my area. I say this because only recently, have I actually had a choice in the matter.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So, I have to apologize to the whole Security community for my idiocy. Yesterday I was made aware of a post about Backtrack 3 Final coming out. The link I received was a link to Mut’s blog. While reading the post it mentioned something about an early IRC release. Proceeding to IRC I found a direct link to the ISO in the topic. Excited about the release I failed to read the rest of the topic in IRC mentioning that they wanted it to stay within the IRC community.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Recently I have been hearing a lot of innovators posting to their blogs that they are pursuing new employment with Microsoft, and I wonder if they are making sneaky power plays into the Open Source market. Taking it’s best projects and plucking their leads. For example:

I am a part of a great many projects but I can’t say that I have contributed to them very much.]]></description>
