      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard already about Jasager.. well you probably don&amp;rsquo;t read this blog, but for those who want to know a bit more about the history of Jasager - Karma on the Fon, where the project is now, and where it&amp;rsquo;s headed, then buckle up, and hang on while we first travel down memory lane.
History: The time was ShmooCon 2006. It was my very first &amp;ldquo;HACKER&amp;rdquo; convention. I was there with my buddies from Hak5 and SploitCast.</description>
