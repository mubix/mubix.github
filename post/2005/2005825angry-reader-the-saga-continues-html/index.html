<p><strong>I got this today</strong></p>

<p>**Ashley: **<br />
<em>Well you now what, I have always had a problem believing people but I grew out of it. And now I realize why I never trusted people before because they cant be trusted. You post a lie on the internet and dont even let anyone know it is a lie. If you wanted to make a joke you should have keep that website private with a password or something. Not just have it out there for any “gullible high school girl”, can read. But you know what you got got your joke&hellip;Ha Ha Ha. I laughed at it.I respect you for send ing me the email telling methat is was just a joke but you should have never put it on there. I didnt know that they would let anybody put anything on the internet but I guess that is another way the world has gone wrong.Later<br />

<p><strong>This is what I sent back:</strong><br />
<em>Ashley:</em></p>

<p>_People can be trusted. You have to trust people to get along in this world. Just don’t take everything you see or read as fact. I assume you live america, and if I am wrong I apologize, but the freedom of speech is what makes our country great, and what I hope keeps the internet as great as it is. You have the right to say whatever you want, whereever you want. I don’t believe freedom on the internet makes the whole world bad. I think that it is one of it’s fine points. But, you are free to think as you wish, hence only furthering my point. But I will, for you, change what I have posted to say that it is actually untrue.</p>

<p><em>P.S. Remind your boyfriend and his platoon that we are all in support of him.</em></p>

<p><strong>She responded:</strong><br />
<em>I am sure that they appreciate your support. I do live in America adn i know that everyone has a freedom of speech. But I think people cross the line when they start making up stuff. Anybody in the world has access to the internet. So if an enemy over seas saw that, they could have planned an attack because they thought all of our men were coming back over here. I know that if we are over there, they will bomb over there, and if they are here, they will bomb here but more people have access to that website than what you think. I think about everyone in this world not just making a joke about my friends. If that website was viewed by the wrong person, it could cause all hell to break loose. Well, I just hope next time you think about other people before you post something false on the internet for the entire world to se.<br />
Ashley Park</em></p>

<p><strong>This is how I responded:</strong></p>

<p><em>I doubt that any enemy can figure out any sort of location from what I<br />
posted. If they can, they are smarter than you and I, and in so being,<br />
would most likely know that it is false. Hell is not going to break<br />
loose because of one web page. On another point. You think people<br />
cross the line when “they start making up stuff”.. what do you call<br />
the news?</em></p>

<p>_ _</p>

<p>_A friend of mine pointed out to me a very old joke:<br />
“I read it on the internet, so it must be true”<br />
_</p>

<p><strong>This is becoming a real drama. Seinfeld?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is how she responded to that:</strong><br />
<em>The comment that you made about them being smarter than you and I. Could you hijack two airplanes and fly them into a building and then disappear? They can. Can you hack into The United States Government computer to find out our plots. Could you be the master-mind of series of terrorist attacks? I doubt it why because they want us.Therefore they work hard and “Do their research”. They could make us into puppets if they really wanted too. Because America is vulnerable and everyone knows it. There are no secrets here, you can find out anythign you want to know about anyone on the damn internet.You can find out how to build bombs on the internet. So dont tell me that they are no smarter than us. American are DUMB. If we were smart we would have never sent our troops over there. We should have dropped an atomic bomb over there and be done with it. But now more and more of our people are being killed because AMERICA is DUMB. The bad thing is that nobody here realizes this, but everyone over seas and all of our enemies know this. They are just waiting on us to make another mistake so they can cause another 9-11. Like the plane that crashed. How do you think that the radio got changed from the corrrect channel to a different when they went to calling for mayday??? OKay then.They are over here right underneath our noses but we cant see them because we are all stuck up of own asses because we are Americans and we live in the land of the free. Well if we dont thighten up, we aint goignt o be living in the land of the free we are goignt o either be living on their land being their slaves.Or they are goignt o kill us all. We are supposedly winning the war~How do you figure when our death tolls keep climbing and theirs may rise a few a week. So I think that they are a little bit smarter than us.And if you still dont see where iam coming from, you need to get your head out of your butt, watch the news, and then see what you think.<br />
