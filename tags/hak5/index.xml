    <description><![CDATA[First off, this is dead simple and shouldn&rsquo;t work, but it does. Also, there is no possible way that I&rsquo;m the first one that has identified this, but here it is (trust me, I tested it so many ways to confirm it because I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was true)

History: The time was ShmooCon 2006. It was my very first &ldquo;HACKER&rdquo; convention. I was there with my buddies from Hak5 and SploitCast.]]></description>
