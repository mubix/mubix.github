  <h1>Offensive Security Certified Professional</h1>

<div class="content">
  <p>I recently obtained the status <strong>Offensive Security Certified Professional</strong>. It is one of the best courses I have ever taken. It challenged me to think and learn new skills on the fly. You start the course with a bunch of video files, a huge pdf and an lzm file to get your VPN setup. It is self paced and intense. The topics cover everything from <a href="http://www.remote-exploit.org/">Back|Track</a> basics to the HXDEF rootkit.</p>

<p>Here is the problem, you can&rsquo;t get a job with it. I know that seems shallow, but let me explain. As I see it there are basically 3 types of certifications or for that matter education in general that you can go through. The first gets you a job. The second teaches you something. The third is good for you or fun.This course is fun but more so falls in the &lsquo;teaches you something&rsquo; category. The CISSP on the other hand help you get a job, but I&rsquo;ll hold that topic for another post.</p>

<p>Well, the <a href="http://offensive-security.com/offsec101.php">Offensive Security 101</a> course (leads to the OSCP test), is not quite on the radars of any recruiters or for that matter companies yet. Which is truly a shame. Unlike the CISSP and almost every other certification that I know of or heard of via 3rd party, this cert makes you &ldquo;<em><strong>try harder</strong></em>&rdquo;. And all of the pain ends in a 24 hour marathon of hacking, where you will be an idiot not to use every second of it.</p>

<p>I have been a huge supporter of Back|Track for ages and they have really shifted my thinking of certifications by providing the Offsec 101 course. I can&rsquo;t wait to take their other courses, Wi-Fu and Back|Track to the Max (which I am told that my mind will melt during the course of study). They also have some <a href="http://offensive-security.com/ilt.php">instructor led training</a> so you can get one on one with Muts or one of the other crazy brains behind <a href="http://offensive-security.com">OFFENSIVE SECURITY</a>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for classes via their website: <a href="http://offensive-security.com/training.php">http://offensive-security.com/training.php</a></p>

<p>Also check out some of their videos here: <a href="http://offensive-security.com/videos.php">http://offensive-security.com/videos.php</a></p>

<p>**Update: **Back|Track to the Max is now named:<a href="http://offensive-security.com/ctp.php"> Cracking the Perimeter</a> which ends in your OSCE (Offensive Security Certified Expert) exam.</p>
