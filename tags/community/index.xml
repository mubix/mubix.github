      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s often tough from both hiring and job hunters to find one another at conferences. I think this is mostly because of a couple things.
 No one wants to stand at a booth on either side and talk job stuff in front of a bunch of people and people at booths rarely get the chance to get away. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to know &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; to talk to.  So I created a very simple Google doc to help put twitter handles and links together for people who are job hunting and people who are hiring to kinda get to know who to talk to.</description>
