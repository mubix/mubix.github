<p>So, it&rsquo;s over. <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org">ShmooCon</a> and the meet up is finally over. I had a blast, but it put a tax on my time like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe. I can&rsquo;t imagine what life is like for the <a href="http://www.shmoo.com">Shmoo group</a>, especially <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/27158652@N00/86418247/">Heidi</a>. I will be posting all of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mubix/sets/72157600031734284/">pictures on flickr</a> shortly. I got to do a lot of other things at <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org">ShmooCon</a> other than just the meet up. I had the distinct opportunity to help bag over <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bre/431531146/">1000 bags</a> with swag, Shmooballs, and adverts. And, yes, if you are reading this Freshman, I AM COMPLAINING! However, I will not complain about doing <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org/labs.html">ShmooCon Labs</a>. Here is the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/btmspox/434923275/">network diagram</a> if you wanna see the extent of what would would have paled most enterprise networks.  Ok, as for the meet up, I need a name for it, and I am totally not creative, so those 3 who read my blog, I charge you to help a fellow Internet addict out. We had people come from <a href="http://www.pauldotcom.com/">Pauldotcom</a>, <a href="http://www.hak5.org/">Hak.5</a>, <a href="http://cyberspeak.libsyn.com/">Cyberspeak</a>, <a href="http://www.mckeay.net/">Martin Mckeay</a>, <a href="http://www.sploitcast.com/">SploitCast</a>, <a href="http://www.nmrc.org/~thegnome/">Simple Nomad</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mubix/437155223/">Rodney from the Shmoo</a> Group, <a href="http://www.renderlab.net/">Render Man</a>, and a surprise showing of two other security podcasts you should definitely check out, <a href="http://www.secthis.com/">Secthis</a> and <a href="http://cmdln.wordpress.com/">Cmdln</a>. It went great except for a few things, which didn&rsquo;t make it bad, just a little more interesting. Lets just say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy</a> tried very hard. The manager that knew about our reservation, that gave us the ok to keep the place open late, and have a tab, went MIA. So we improvised by using a gift card that kept being passed around, taking over the whole place so that a reservation wasn&rsquo;t needed, and moving the party to another bar after they forced us out. The travel to the bar was another story all by it&rsquo;s self. We walk about 1.5 miles to the next bar, which no one was sure where it was. Now, &ldquo;WE&rdquo; is about 40 of the 50 to 60 people that were at <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/">Chipotle</a>, all walking on the side walk, half drunk, a mile and a half. You are now thinking one of two things: 1. That would have been hilarious to see, or 2. People will walk the desert for free beer/drinks.
