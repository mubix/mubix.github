    <description><![CDATA[Sponsors: We have had a lot of great response for everyone on this year&rsquo;s event! I want to reiterate, this event is for podcasters, bloggers, twitter addicts, and everyone in between. I would also like to announce an update to our sponsor&rsquo;s lineup:
TheAcademyPro.com / TheAcademyHome.com
These are twin sites catering videos to the security pro looking to learn about everything from enterprise gear to Maltego, and the home user trying to start the learning about security and how to secure their own computers without going to you the IT guy in the family.]]></description>
