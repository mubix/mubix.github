    <description><![CDATA[Everyone has their list of hostnames they brute force domains with. In my last post I even mentioned a few ways to use one with XARGS or PARALLEL. But one fact about wordlist brute forcing is that there is no &ldquo;one list to rule them all&rdquo;. But over the years of doing DNS record collection I have noticed one thing, most domains have a large number of short hostnames that are easy to remember, usually 4 characters or less.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Chris Gates wrote a blog post about the &lsquo;getvncpw&rsquo; meterpreter script. I ran into the same issue on Penetration Tests in the past but didn&rsquo;t know much about the wacked out version of DES that RFB (the VNC protocol) was using.
