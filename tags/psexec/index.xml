    <description><![CDATA[This is a quick blog post on how to elevate to SYSTEM without the need for PSEXEC when you are using PowerShell, or more specifcially in this case, PowerShell Remoting (WinRM).
First off, let me introduce my tool of choice here. It&rsquo;s Evil-WinRM. I spoke about it in the Practical Exploitation video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVgJ-9FJKxE, so I won&rsquo;t go too far indepth.

Ya, and normally I&rsquo;d agree that it&rsquo;s the best level to have, but the defenses these days have gotten better, and getting direct connections out is pretty rare. That leaves proxies, and as you know SYSTEM doesn&rsquo;t get any proxy settings.]]></description>
