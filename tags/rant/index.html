If it helps, think of your time as a vault, money is withdrawn at a constant rate by people as you spend it, but you are not allowed to look inside to see how much you have left. It could be a billion dollars, it could be .</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I recently took the plunge and joined a startup called R5 Industries. I wanted to say thanks for all the well wishes that I received on social media. It has certainly calmed my nerves about the choice ;-).
I&rsquo;ve had a number of people ask what R5 Industries does. Our primary selling point is AntigenC2, which is a really Command and Control detection product (no agents). But we also do Red Team assessments and some other fun toys if you are interested, contact@r5industries.</p></div>

@mubix I have my class in 4 hours. Would you be willing to post a &#39;hello&#39; and maybe some hacking advice for my class demo? #PSUBehrend #CTF
&mdash; Krystal Elliott (@krystropolis) September 24, 2015  I thought about it on my entire 1 hour drive home from just turning in my badge and laptop from a big corporation to go work at a start up.</p></div>

I didn&rsquo;t know Aaron Swartz, or even 1% of what he was doing in the world to make it a better place and for that I am ashamed. I will do better, to look around, see what needs to be changed in this world and make it a reality.</p></div>

I am still pretty much a runt in the infosec community as I didn&rsquo;t even begin learning computers (outside of playing games on them) until 2005.</p></div>

There are naysayers: http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/
And then there is the truth: http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html
I like the design of the tabs and address bar, but I can do that with a theme in firefox. I want my add-ons, even with the memory problems. Chrome is great for Mom and Pap, but for “Internet Power Users” it falls lightyears short on features. So where is the brass tax?</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I recently was Stumbling and happened across the following video. Now, when people use StumbleUpon they are usually bored and aren’t really contributing to the world as we know it. It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.
My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I am truely getting tired of iPhone &ldquo;Web Apps&rdquo;. I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone. They do have a pretty interface and I have to give props to some of the design developers, but does this seem more of a copout to anyone else?
I&rsquo;ll give an example. I LOVE Remember the Milk.</p></div>
