      <description>AKA - ROB WRITES POWERSHELL!!
Yesterday I posted a way to dump hashes using a Domain Controller account. But how do you know which account to use? And when was it&amp;rsquo;s password last set? net user unfortunately won&amp;rsquo;t do computer accounts.
So I decided to write a PowerShell script to find out. Unfortunately Windows 7 doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module (I&amp;rsquo;m sure there is another way to do this but here is how I did it.</description>

      <description>Metasploit Minute has entered into it&amp;rsquo;s 3rd &amp;ldquo;season&amp;rdquo;. And we kick it off with using the Metasploit capture modules to capture creds from this powershell popup. The cool thing about this is you can leave it to execute on a system without any other code on disk and get creds constantly as any level of user. No admin, no UAC bypass needed. Just a bunch of creds for free.. over SSL.</description>

      <title>AD Zone Transfers as a user</title>

      <description>cross posted from: http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2013/10/ad-zone-transfers-as-user.html
The tired and true method for Zone Transfers are using either nslookup:
nslookup ls -d domain.com.local  Or dig:
dig -t AXFR domain.com.local @ns1.domain.com.local  In the Windows Enterprise world there are a few more options. If you are a DNS Admin you can use the &amp;lsquo;dnscmd&amp;rsquo; command like so:
dnscmd /EnumZones dnscmd /ZonePrint domain.com.local  Which is handy if you can pop the DNS server (usually the Domain Controller so you usually have better things to do at that point).</description>
