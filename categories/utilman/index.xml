      <description>At CCDC, Sticky Keys via RDP was a very successful re-entry point for the Red Team. You can read more about how this works here:
http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2012/04/privilege-escalation-via-sticky-keys.html
So if you can get physical access or SYSTEM/Admin access at some point and enable + reach RDP, you can very easily follow those instructions and gain a level of persistance without the need of a pesky password :-)
However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well with the advent of NLA or Network-Level-Authentication, which was enabled for Vista systems and beyond.</description>
