    <description><![CDATA[TL;DR Here are the concerns I have regarding the SolarWinds/FireEye breach:
The accounts stored in an organization&rsquo;s SolarWinds Orion may be underestimated. I recently did a pentest for a firm that had over 200 credentials stored in their SolarWinds Orion database, but only 15 showed in the interface (the SolarWinds credential interface is complicated with sections for each connection type and different panes for each, it may also not properly delete credentials from the database when &ldquo;removed&rdquo; from the interface, I am unsure).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[LanManager passwords (&ldquo;LM&rdquo;) is a very old and well known password hashing function. Used way back in OS/2 Warp and MS-Net (networking for MS-DOS). It was great in it&rsquo;s day, however how it worked was not sustainable. The hashing was performed only haver uppercasing and splitting the password into two 7 character chunks. This meant that even if your password was 14 characters long, it was still technically only two 7 character passwords, that could be cracked separately.]]></description>
