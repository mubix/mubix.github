						<div class="post-summary"><p>Gary Vaynerchuk of Wine Library TV made a post about Ego Searching. He describes in this short video that ego searching when you are trying to make a brand is simply caring about your audience:
 Now even Leo Laporte, while being interviewed on the Geek Cred podcast said that as a broadcaster (which can be translated into “Content Producer”), your audience is the most important thing and your responsibility is to them.</p></div>

More to the point, I have reached a certain level of ‘zen’ with my GTD methods on gmail. I am in a constant battle for “Inbox Zero” and have “Starring” extremely useless for me.</p></div>

Maltego is an awesome tool, it’s also GIVEN AWAY for FREE.. As in beer, which they allow you to use their servers to do your stupid little ego searches on.** STOP TRYING TO STEAL IT.**
Offensive Security 101. This is by far the best course / certification that I have attempted thus far in my career.</p></div>

In the mean time while I fix myself, here are a couple sites that can keep you busy:
Search google for exploits:

  Watch just about any TV show (and some movies) online:

There are naysayers: http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/
And then there is the truth: http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html
I like the design of the tabs and address bar, but I can do that with a theme in firefox. I want my add-ons, even with the memory problems. Chrome is great for Mom and Pap, but for “Internet Power Users” it falls lightyears short on features. So where is the brass tax?</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I recently was Stumbling and happened across the following video. Now, when people use StumbleUpon they are usually bored and aren’t really contributing to the world as we know it. It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.
My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I am truely getting tired of iPhone &ldquo;Web Apps&rdquo;. I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone. They do have a pretty interface and I have to give props to some of the design developers, but does this seem more of a copout to anyone else?
I&rsquo;ll give an example. I LOVE Remember the Milk.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Now, I don’t like to publicly bad mouth companies, but at some point, Comcast’s lack of “service” has got to stop. Well, let me rephrase that: Comcast needs to be held accountable for their utter lack of due diligence. I have been a Comcast customer by default ever since they swallowed the portion of Adelphia that held my area. I say this because only recently, have I actually had a choice in the matter.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>So, I have to apologize to the whole Security community for my idiocy. Yesterday I was made aware of a post about Backtrack 3 Final coming out. The link I received was a link to Mut’s blog. While reading the post it mentioned something about an early IRC release. Proceeding to IRC I found a direct link to the ISO in the topic. Excited about the release I failed to read the rest of the topic in IRC mentioning that they wanted it to stay within the IRC community.</p></div>
