<p>Last Friday (March 6th, 2009) I posed the question above. What I got in return was nothing short of amazing, and to tell you the truth, it amazed me how the tally rounded out. I categorized the answers and counted them up (MANAGERS, listen up!):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(12 votes) - Security Fundamentals: This category involves the application of A/V, IDS/IPS, basic safe surfing techniques, least privilege use, and an understanding of phishing. It astounds me that this is at the top of the list. I grouped all of these answers together because they truly are the BASICS of Information Security. Why after all these years have managers of security professionals not gotten this drilled into them to the point of bleeding? What are we doing wrong?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(8 votes) - Targeting: &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t a target&rdquo;, &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything on saying we are getting attacked&rdquo;. This is another that surprised me to be at the top of the list. How can managers not think that 1. that they are a target, and 2. think that because there aren&rsquo;t any alarms going off, they aren&rsquo;t getting attacked?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(6 votes) - Passwords: Complexity, not using stickies, rotation, etc. I left this out of Security Fundamentals, because it&rsquo;s not an easy beast to over come. It&rsquo;s something that definitely needs to be addressed and a plan set down for the application, enforcement and technology behind it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(6 votes) - Compliance and Policy: Everyone in this category made it abundantly clear that compliance to a standard does NOT mean that you are secure, but not at least making the compliance bar is worse. Internal policies need to be created to provide a stricter regimen then the compliance checklist demonstrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(5 votes) - Accountability: From basic user to CEO and Security Analyst. Accountability has many faces but it usually shows none of them in the security world. Users of the world learn quick when one of coworkers get restricted access because they clicked test phishing  after they had just gone through phishing training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(5 votes) - Defense In Depth: This is an old concept as well, but in recent years have been twisted to include DiD at host and network infrastructure level. The phrase Defense In Dept will continue to grow as the depths at which we can put protections on info systems grows. You need to realize that you ARE a target and you NEED to move with this evolution, not ignore it. Doing so doesn&rsquo;t make it &ldquo;go away&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(3 votes) - Users are stupid: I can&rsquo;t believe that this even made it as an item. Managers, you seriously don&rsquo;t understand that your weakest link on your network is the users?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2 votes) - Data Layer Protection: Encryption. Even if the client data is stored on a super &ldquo;secure&rdquo; data node, that doesn&rsquo;t mean somewhere between point A and point B isnt&rsquo; compromised. If it&rsquo;s sensitive or secret, it needs to be treated as such at EVERY juncture where that data is transferred or can be accessed from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2 votes) - Risk Management: Managers, this is supposedly your specialty. Get back to it, they want you to be open to understand technically why this or that isn&rsquo;t a threat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(1 vote) - Company buy-in: I am truly surprised this didn&rsquo;t make the top of the list. I personally think that company buy-in to security should precede the rest of the categories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is simply a top 10 list of things we as Security Professionals want you to know. It would not be hard to create training in your organization around these 10 categories. If you are a manager or one of us, get it started, make the slides and start getting these topics nailed down.</p>
<p>I have included the raw tweets from the poll so that you as managers can understand what your people want you to learn:</p>
