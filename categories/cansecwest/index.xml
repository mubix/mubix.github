      <description>In 2012 @egypt and I taught Metasploit Mastery for a day and a half @DerbyCon . This was a lot of fun but we had to cram a TON of slides into that short period of time. PLUS we had a CTF at the end where people had to break into a corporate network (virtualized) and sell their shells, data, passwords, or flags to us (egypt and I were acting as opposing countries).</description>
