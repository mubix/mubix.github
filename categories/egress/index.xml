    <description><![CDATA[In the previous post: http://www.room362.com/blog/2012/8/11/let-me-out-of-your-net-workndashintro.html I told you about letmeoutofyour.net, but how does it work?
Things we need to accomplish on the server:
Listen on all ports Answer for all hostnames and subdomains Answer for all HTTP verbs, file and folder requests ONE: Listen on all ports

But back to that in a sec, egress ‘busting’ or getting your payload/backdoor/trojan/c2 out of someone’s network once you’ve gotten that ever elusive “CODE EXECUTION HAPPY DANCE” going on isn’t always easy. There is even a Metasploit payload for it called ‘allports’:

There is also ‘Egress Buster’ by the guys over at TrustedSec which can do 1000 ports in just a few seconds:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I have had the idea for this app for a long time, expressed it a few times, but never really pushed, and I sure that I am not the only one who has thought of or wanted an app like Ear Trumpet by Robin Wood.
