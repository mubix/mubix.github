<p>December 2nd, I drove down to Williamsburg VA to meet up with the guys from Hak.5 and Frank Linhares. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know. Hak.5 is an IPTV (Vidcast) show, which basically boils down to a TV show on the internet. Anyways, I got to meet up with these fellas and a couple other interesting people. While I was there, I had the privilege of helping out not only in the live <a href="http://www.techphile.ca">techPhile</a> podcast by Frank Linhares, but also the &lsquo;glue&rsquo; segments of Ep 5 of Hak.5. I must say, if and of the Hak.5 crew or Frank are reading this; it was a great pleasure to hang out with you guys. I would also like to make some personal shout outs to each one, and because this is my site. I get to. Muhahaha.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frank</strong>: It was awesome to meet and get to know you. You still owe me dinner! ;-) But seriously, it was an honor to help out with the show.</li>
<li><strong>Darren</strong>: You have Hak.5 on lock, keep up the awesome work, and it was cool meeting you. Thanks for the invite. Inviting someone you have never met into your home is a big deal to me, thanks for the trust and respect.</li>
<li><strong>Wess</strong>: I love you man. We need to tell Alli about us before this gets ugly.</li>
<li><strong>Harrison</strong>: It was sweet meeting you man. We became fast friends; you and I think a lot alike. (&lsquo;cept for cars: Ferrari Sucks) and I think <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org">ShmooCon 2006</a> is gonna rock.</li>
<li><strong>Jon</strong>: Man, we will get Gentoo done. If you need any further help you guys got my number - Mubix – Tech Support <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> 365. Keep it real man.</li>
<li><strong>Alli, Paul, Harrison&rsquo;s Mom, and Jui-Chia</strong>: It was cool hanging out with you guys. I had a blast down there. 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour commute is worth it to hang out w/ you guys.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>One last thanks goes out to all the people in the IRC channel <a href="irc://irc.techphile.ca">techPhile IRC server</a> #hak5 and #techphile for making my moderation a cake walk. Except for a certain individual, all the questions were perfect and I only had to fix/deny a few of them.</p>
