                <p>Nick Harbour wrote a <a href="https://blog.mandiant.com/archives/1786">post on Mandiants blog</a> about some Malware that was using a dll called &lsquo;fxsst.dll&rsquo; to hide and stay persistent on a system. The DLL is used by Windows when it is acting as a Fax server (anyone still do that?). He mentions some very interesting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DLL gets loaded at login by Explorer</li>
<li>The DLL exists in System32 but is looked for in Windows first</li>
<li>Explorer doesn&rsquo;t try to use anything inside of it via exports unless the system is acting as a fax server (aka safe to put a pretty bland DLL there)</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought&hellip; no it couldn&rsquo;t be that simple&hellip; lets see:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201106_fxsst_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We have our victim in a session and are going to make a DLL that points back to our reverse_https multi handler over port 443</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201106_fxsst_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ok, we&rsquo;ve got our super evil fxsst.dll now lets put it in place.</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201106_fxsst_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lets test it out just to make sure it works. I will use the PID of explorer.exe (cause thats where it&rsquo;s going to be normally) and I&rsquo;m going to use the method I talked about in the <a href="/blog/2011/5/30/remote-dll-injection-with-meterpreter">Remote DLL Injection post</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201106_fxsst_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Woot! Ok, so the DLL works, but does it load when a user logs in&hellip; (drop out of our 2 sessions first)</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201106_fxsst_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Thats me logging in 2 times because I couldn&rsquo;t believe that it worked. System was fine, and I had a shell. These tests were performed on XP. On Win7 x64 it make the systems freeze up. Right now the DLL payload generation in Metasploit for 64bit systems isn&rsquo;t setup. So, stay away from doing this on x64 bit systems at least with the Metasploit DLL, since it&rsquo;s run at login so you&rsquo;ll have to use psexec or another session to actually remove the file while everyone is logged out. TEST PRIOR TO USE as always.</p>
