      <description>It seems like every week there is a new compromise of some service or another. But as a user what are you supposed to do with this knowledge? Here are some suggestions on things to do or think about when reacting:
 Do you use the password you use there anywhere else? Think about starting to use a password manager like LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, or a product like Yubico. This way you can very easily use different passwords for different sites.</description>

      <description>Penetration Testing / Red Teaming requires the use of a lot of tools. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind getting called a &amp;ldquo;script kiddie&amp;rdquo; because I can accomplish more and faster when I don&amp;rsquo;t have to code every single task I need to do. This post is to point out companies that make this possible and give a small bit of thanks.
(If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to convince a company to give something away for free, you can understand how big this really is)Â Some give a lot, some only one tool, but even one is more than some.</description>

      <description>When Google Reader decided to remove everything it was good for, we all scrambled to find new homes for things we wanted to share. Tumblr became a place that most of us flocked. I&amp;rsquo;ve found Tumblr to be not a very good substitue for Google Reader&amp;rsquo;s functionality (IMHO).
The other day, carnal0wnage told me about a service called &amp;lsquo;Buffer&amp;rsquo;, and all this thing does is do scheduled tweets, but it has one distinct feature, not only is it focused around the sharing of links, it works (if you install the browser plugin/extension) INSIDE OF GOOGLE READER ;-) So you can be reading a feed item, push a button and not have to open a page or another app, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all right there.</description>

You can read the details on the above link, but it boils down to you make an application for iPhone or Android. You make it vulnerable to X,Y,Z types of flaws, you win a 32gb iPad or a Motorola Xoom.
Added bonus, all the apps get submitted to OWASP for people to learn Mobile security.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There is no stupid question&amp;rdquo; but, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet this checklist, it&amp;rsquo;s officially a time wasting one.
Acceptable questions checklist:
1. Have I tried it
2. Have I checked the manual, wiki, or forum
3. Have I googled and searched for an answer
 All marks must be achieved before a question is asked unless the target of the question is getting paid to answer the source&amp;rsquo;s inquires &amp;ldquo;Have I tried it&amp;rdquo; mark can only be skipped in the case of life threatening actions  PDF version is available upon request.</description>

      <description>Normally I save links for my &amp;ldquo;Mubix Links&amp;rdquo; blog to keep the clutter down on this one, but I think this is one that I would like to highlight as important. The NFO, credits and summary to this copyrighted video is what I wish to highlight.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5573874/HackersWanted%282008%29
I am against the misuse of copyrighted material, and it is a violation of laws in many countries, including my own.
I really wish this video would have been published, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it would have been a very interesting video, that I definitely would have purchased.</description>

      <description>Practical Exploitation is going to be me, explaining things in the way that I see the world on the best medium for what I&amp;rsquo;m explaining, be it a short blog blurb, a video of me, a video of a desktop, or just audio. There is no schedule that I&amp;rsquo;ll be sticking to, but I will guarantee you 3 things though:
 If you want it explained and it has to do with infosec or hacking (I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best on the hardware side), it will be on the show.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it all over twitter yet, achillean released the &amp;ldquo;beta&amp;rdquo; of SHODAN yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s a search engine of basically a nmap of the internet (ports 21, 22, 23 or 80 so far).
http://shodan.surtri.com/
You can search by keyword, and/or using any of the advanced search options.
 country: 2-letter country code hostname: full or partial host name net: IP range using CIDR notation (ex: 18.7.7.0/24 ) port: 21, 22, 23 or 80  Here is just a taste of the power this bring to the game:</description>

      <description>(This post got lost in the intertubes and it took a bit to get back, Archive.org nor Google cache had it)
I get this question all the time: âWhy room362.com?â I have answered that question in a lot of ways, depending on the perceived amount of time I had to tell the story. But, on a blog you have tons of time, right? Not if you are studying the Twitter boom.</description>

      <description>Continuing my âGetting your fill ofâ series
Dave Shackleford recently posted an excellent blog entry titled âOne for the n00bsâ: http://daveshackleford.com/?p=277
It relates the security community to a high school cafeteria. Itâs a good read and pretty dead on. I want to echo his sentiments, âI got my OWN lunch table. And youâre invited.â, Iâm just an email away. I also wanted to let you know there are a lot of places where you can learn on your own, at your own pace, and without any chance of ridicule.</description>

      <description>Yes, I just called everyone who works at Apple an Oompa Loompa, but I digress:
I was reading Brooke Crothers&amp;rsquo; story on the Apple &amp;lsquo;gag&amp;rsquo; order [1] and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of how Apple has created an almost similar situation. Everyone wants to know what Apple is up to, can&amp;rsquo;t stop talking about it. Buzz Out Loud [2] even had people call and email asking them to see if they could do a show without mentioning Apple or the iPhone.</description>

      <description>The site has been down for a while, there were a lot of factors that played into that, but mostly it was focus on some family, as I had some in town. I also came to the conclusion that it&amp;rsquo;s time to move to &amp;ldquo;the cloud&amp;rdquo; so I moved over to SquareSpace (using the coupon code: DEFCON &amp;lt;/end shameless plug&amp;gt;). I have an actual web designer looking at hooking this thing up right.</description>

Now that he has a name, it is only fitting that he has a domain and a blog. Please, come, register under the name bob_#### with a mailinator address to match, or your own name and email address if you wish. Iâll moderate all posts simply for spam purposes and have them up post haste.</description>

      <description>The Full Disclosure mailing list has a long and illustrious past. It has played host to everything from zero days to politics. One thing that has rung true for a number of years, if not since itâs inception is that it is unregulated (save spam of course). However in recent months it has fallen pray to less and less technical discussions, and more bickering, name calling, and outright trolling.
The reason for this post is to let everyone know that has unsubscribed, that a change is coming.</description>

      <description>TiVo and DVRs in general have brought TV watching a long way. Some of the innovations that have come of it have made the TV experience better. Commercial skipping is my own personal favorite. But some of the other features are pausing, rewinding, and fast forwarding (after you are behind a bit obviously) and finally recording.Â Now, recording live TV is nothing new. People have done it since VCRs were invented, and Iâm sure much before then.</description>

      <description>Gary Vaynerchuk of Wine Library TV made a post about Ego Searching. He describes in this short video that ego searching when you are trying to make a brand is simply caring about your audience:
 Now even Leo Laporte, while being interviewed on the Geek Cred podcast said that as a broadcaster (which can be translated into âContent Producerâ), your audience is the most important thing and your responsibility is to them.</description>

      <description>Unless you have been hiding under a rock, or just started reading this blog today. You have heard about GoPC. I featured it in my USB Goodies 2008 and I love their product. Now that they have entered into a âStrategic Allianceâ with a company called ThinLinX. Now, the details of this alliance and the future it holds arenât clear at the moment. And of course I have my own speculations.</description>

      <description>Many of you know who operat0r is, Darren in particular since operat0r pulled a magic trick on Darrenâs ACER ONE (Archive.org Links) that turned it from brick to badass in less than 5 minutes. But what some of you may not know is that olâ McCurdy (operat0r) has some other awesome side projects that run the same course as my style of apps. PORTABLE. But these arenât the standard portable apps that I find on the net.</description>

      <description>Ok, it&amp;rsquo;s not to you, but it is to a good cause. Here is their blurb:
Hackers for Charity helps non-malicious hackers gain valuable job experience by putting them to work on projects for charity. They also build computer classrooms to help children and adults break the cycle of poverty through empowerment training, and feed children with funds raised by sales of Johnny Long&amp;rsquo;s books.
This month, I thought that it would be fun to partner up with Hackers for Charity in order to raise money for the people of Uganda.</description>

      <description>So I have graduated from the black and green standard hacker theme (with forest header) to a much easier to read and iPhone friendly theme. I have also added a few things to the site. Probably the most noticeable is the new logo. The logo was the created by my good friend TestMAD. He is a starving graphic artist that runs the IRC network ThinStack. He also supports a number of other projects like Geekcred, and Wess Tobler&amp;rsquo;s new project, Unpersons.</description>

      <description>Haven&amp;rsquo;t had enough conferences yet? First, thanks to everyone who entered through email, twitter and commenting on the CSI give away. Second we do have a winner so please stop the flood. But, on to the show.
The SC World Congress, Dec. 9-10, 2008, at the Javits Convention Center in New York is offering a dicount code to all readers of SBN (Security Blogger&amp;rsquo;s Network). But what is &amp;ldquo;The SC World Congress&amp;rdquo; Here is what they say:</description>

      <description>What is CSI? This is what CSI says about it:
 Security is in transition. There is general agreement that security does not work, but not on how to fix it. CSI 2008 is the only event today that faces the challenge to reconsider security. This year at CSIâs annual event, the most innovative minds in security will grapple with the tough questions, providing a reality-check and alternative to cookie-cutter conferences that merely tweak the status quo.</description>

      <description>So there are all kinds of links that I find and queue up to look at but hate keeping them open in tabs, and they arenât always in Google Reader and I donât want to spam to twitter, so Mubixâs Links was born. I setup ScribeFire with a new blogspot account and now, no more tabs, it truely feels like an application of GTD. Plus it allows anyone who is interested to follow along via the blogspot feed.</description>

      <description>So, instead of doing this the right way, which is submitting a bug report to google, I am going to do this the blogger way:
 Publish article to blog about problem in product
 Wait for traffic to rise on blog
 Become giddy at rise in traffic due to outstanding title
 Watch as traffic falls within days
 Become angry and write retort (in said blog, still not contacting the company) getting mad about the STILL unfixed problem</description>

      <description>Pandora is a cool place where you can go and listen to music and it suggests music for you to listen to based off an indepth engine of sorting. Everyone on the podcasting planet has covered this awesome. I donât know what to call it, tool, application, website ,âthingâ. After watching Hak5âs episode showing off time spacing Pandora a while back, a idea started festering in my subconsious. Well, driving home today, it finally surfaced.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I posted a PHP Relay location to my site, and to a Hak5.org&amp;rsquo;s forums. Recently I saw quite a bit of traffic going directly to that URL. I have taken action to ensure that this privledge that I am extending to the world, free of charge, is not abused. I have a cron job running that assess that use of that specific file and by what IPs. It then takes any IP with use over a certain limit and adds them to a complete block, to the relay, to my site, and any other site that I host.</description>

      <description>Today I saw on Bugtraq a new 0 day coming that affects all up to date versions of windows. The most extraordinary part of this, and similar disclosures, is their workarounds. Since Redmond has decided not to patch, until a later date, it is up to the discloser or a likeminded individual to figure out how to protect the masses. Guess what ends up being the fix? âDisable said Microsoft FEATUREâ.</description>

      <description>Most of us in the industry know what the slashdot effect is. But for those who donât. Slashdot.org has such a following, that, when a news article is posted on Slashdot, so many users click on the links provided that a unintentional DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service attack is created, where the news site is taken basically killed by all the traffic that it instantly has to deal with. Well Digg.</description>
