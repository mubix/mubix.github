      <description>Geez. I never have time anymore to put something on this darn thing. I think I am going to stop apologizing for how long it takes me to post, because it is quite quickly becoming the norm. So anyways, since my last post, I have been to ShmooCon &amp;lsquo;06
I met some great people to include but not limited to, Lance James, Kevin Mitnick, Fyodor - A.K.A the creator of NMAP, Skydog, DC-Mike, and Simple Nomad.</description>

The above is Morse code. But anyways, we release the first episode of SploitCast yesterday night and we already have 1164 diggs. Which is pretty exciting. A lot of people have said quite a few good things about what we are doing.</description>
