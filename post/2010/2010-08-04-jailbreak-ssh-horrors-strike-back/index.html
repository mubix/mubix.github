            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Back in 2009 the &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.jeltel.com.au/2009/11/interview-with-ikee-iphone-virus.html">ikee</a>&rdquo; rick-rolling worm went around the iPhone world via the password of &lsquo;alpine&rsquo; on the root account. You are now warned to change your root password when you pop into Cydia and Rock the first time. But this thing just wont stay down.</p>

<p>If you have jailbroken your iPad you might want to check out a little file called &ldquo;master.passwd&rdquo;. In it, there is another user called &lsquo;mobile&rsquo; which has been pointed out since 2008 (<a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20080224231344798">here</a>) on the iPhone as another account to change the password of. But the media and Cydia/Rock warnings only put emphasis on &lsquo;root&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Many iPad and iPhone apps STILL do not use the &ldquo;keyring&rsquo;&rdquo; and store your password in plain text or somewhere in a binary file (still plaintext), which the user &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; has access to.</p>

<p>[](/images/postimages/201008_jailbreak_1.png)</p>

<p>Ok, &ldquo;so what&rdquo; you say. Since this recent jailbreak was using a website, the individuals running that site now have the IP address of freshly jailbroken iPhones and iPads. I am certainly not saying that they have any ill intentions, but sites have been broken into before, and that would be one hell of a gold mine.</p>

<p>Hopefully AT&amp;T has put in blocks of some sort so that it&rsquo;s customers are protected, but who knows what the other countries around the world that carry iPhones are doing.</p>

<p>But at the very least, if you have jailbroken your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, please.. please set your passwords accordingly and do not have it a simple dictionary password.</p>

<p>Remember, you ARE giving up some security when you jail break your phone. It is on you to make sure that you lock what you can back down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To change your password, use &lsquo;Terminal&rsquo; and log in to one account at a time and issue the &ldquo;passwd&rdquo; command. You can also just log in to root and issue the &ldquo;passwd mobile&rdquo; command to change the password of mobile</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> on 2010-08-09 19:39 by Rob Fuller</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of comments stating that OpenSSH isn&rsquo;t installed by default and that this is not a big deal at all. A couple problems exist in that argument though:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Jailbreak is executing code on your phone/touch/ipad. Unless you do a analysis of the entire disk, you can&rsquo;t be sure the jailbreak doesn&rsquo;t leave some other way into the phone. Yes, that&rsquo;s a far fetched chance, but most users would never know.</p></li>

<li><p>Even if you don&rsquo;t install it Out-of-the-box. There is a good possibility that you will OpenSSH at a later date. Better to get it fixed while you have it on the mind.</p></li>
</ol>
