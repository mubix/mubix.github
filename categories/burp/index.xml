      <description>First of all, get Robert @RSnake Hansen&amp;rsquo;s RFI list here:
http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20100129/large-list-of-rfis-1000/
it&amp;rsquo;s a great list, but as soon as I saw it, I was like.. hmm.. how can I use that? Well, being that I am a Burp fan, I parsed the .dat with the following line:
cat rfi-locations.dat | grep -v &amp;quot;^#&amp;quot; | awk -F &#39;?&#39; &#39;{print $1}&#39; | sort -u &amp;gt; rsnake_list.txt  This pulls his list down to 906 entries which you can load in to Burp and hammer away with Intruder.</description>

      <description>Idea came thanks to cktricky from: http://cktricky.blogspot.com/
A bunch of sites on the web give you different pages depending on the browser you use to view it. I know when I was a web developer compatibility was the bane of my existence, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure it still is for all the web devs out there. Well, sometimes this leads to bad coding practices, or even the old &amp;ldquo;Google Bot gets to see everything&amp;rdquo; feature.</description>

      <description>CKTricky over at http://cktricky.blogspot.com has been running an awesome Burp Tip of the Day series on his blog. After seeing him use Nikto through Burp. I decided to see if I could just export the list of checks to a text file so that I could use them over and over in Intruder. After a bit of awk and sed hell I figured it out, and submited it to him for acceptance to his BTotD series.</description>
