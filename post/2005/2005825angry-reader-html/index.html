  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I just looked at your ‘referal’ page <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=www.usmc.com&amp;fr=ieas-dns">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=www.usmc.com&amp;fr=ieas-dns</a></p>

<p><a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=www.usmc.com&amp;fr=ieas-dns"> </a></p>

<p>&hellip; you did a search for www.usmc.com&hellip;</p>

<p>This speaks for itself:</p>

<p><strong>Ashley: (A Comment on <a href="/archives/12-USMC-Crack-down-on-Tats.html">USMC: Crack down on Tats</a>)</strong></p>

<p><em>I can’t believe that they are doing this.Everyone in my boyfriends Platoon has a tat.They are over seas dieing and they are worried about tattooes?!!!?!? Shouldnt they be more worried about their safe &hellip;</em></p>

<p><strong>I sent her this email:</strong></p>

<p>__</p>

<p>_I’m sorry to get you all worked up but it was a joke. My buddy is</p>

<p>trying to get back in the Marine Corps and I made that to make him</p>

<p>laugh because they are having a problem with a tatoo that he had</p>

<p>before he came in the first time.</p>

<p>Again, sorry for the confusion</p>

<p>_</p>

<p><em>jd.mubix</em></p>

<p><strong>She sent me this back:</strong></p>

<p>__</p>

<p>_ _</p>

<p><em>THATS TOTALLY RETARDED.IF YOU POST STUFF LIKE THAT, YOU NEED TO MKAE SURE TO TELL EVERYONE ABOUT IT BEING A JOKE. NOW I AM GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT BECAUSE I SENT THAT EMAIL TO MY BOYFRIENDS PLATOON.THANKS A LOT ASSHOLE.</em></p>

<p><strong>I sent this back to her:</strong></p>

<p><em>You know, IF I was an asshole I wouldn’t have even sent you an email</em></p>

<p>_explaining anything, and if you had half a brain you would have</p>

<p>realized it was a farce, or at least emailed me or posted a comment</p>

<p>asking if it was a fake before you rattled off to your boyfriend like a high</p>

<p>school girl with a rumor. That is a great way to take an</p>

<p>apology. It was a joke for a friend who was getting shafted because he</p>

<p>couldn’t come back in with a tattoo he had before came in the first</p>

<p>time. I didn’t make you look stupid, you did that to yourself by</p>

<p>taking something that you read on the Internet as truth without asking</p>

<p>anyone else. I mean, seriously, are you that gullible? Maybe I should</p>

<p>post that the sky is falling.</p>

<p>I was nice the first time and you called me names, now it’s my turn</p>

<p>_</p>

<p><em>&hellip;. nah I’m a nice guy.</em></p>

<p><strong>So, Ashley Park.. ball is in your court.</strong></p>
