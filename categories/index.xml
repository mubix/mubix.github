      <description>&lt;p&gt;Problems are that everyone does this whole blogging thing in so many different ways. Me, personally? I like to have a client that I can save drafts it, work on things a little bit here and there and then finalize stuff when I&amp;rsquo;m ready to post. I have a couple dozen of these posts ready and set with final tweaks needed but my blogging software Squarespace up and moved on to &amp;ldquo;Squarespace 6&amp;rdquo;. The the current stage you don&amp;rsquo;t have to move to 6 but at some point the owners of Squarespace are going to force everyone over. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait for that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Octopress and Postach.io are my favorite options right now. Both blog in markdown language which is ok. Converting 8 years of blog posts to markdown is going to be a lot of work but a one time deal. Plus it would give me a chance to go through and fix the things that were broken over the years of modified blogging clients and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postach.io has one major downside, they don&amp;rsquo;t have good &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; block support, whereas Octopress/Jekyll have excellent support as well code hilighting. The major upside? It&amp;rsquo;s based on Evernote. Which means I can blog from whereever I have Evernote. They also used to have an EXCELLENT feature that seems to have disappeared where if you updated a post it would automatically throw the blog post up to the top of your page, meaning your update would get back in your RSS feed and the update wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go unnoticed as most updates to blog posts do.&lt;/p&gt;
