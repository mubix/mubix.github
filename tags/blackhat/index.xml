      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been pentesting an organization that had LAPS, you know that it is the best solution for randomizing local administrator passwords on the planet. (You should just be leaving them disabled).
LAPS stores it&amp;rsquo;s information in Active Directory:
 The expiration time: ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime: 131461867015760024
 And the actual password in clear text: ms-Mcs-AdmPwd: %v!e#7S#{s})+y2yS#(
  When LAPS first came it, any user in Active Directory could read it.</description>

      <description>Each year I make up a list the week before Blackhat and Def Con of talks that I &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t miss&amp;rdquo; and some that I want to see (and use it for video watching afterwards for those I missed). This year I thought I would share that list here. I will be breaking them down by each day of the events by time slot. Any talk I have a ðŸŒŸ by, is a &amp;ldquo;Must see&amp;rdquo; for me.</description>
