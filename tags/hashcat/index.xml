      <description>LanManager passwords (&amp;ldquo;LM&amp;rdquo;) is a very old and well known password hashing function. Used way back in OS/2 Warp and MS-Net (networking for MS-DOS). It was great in it&amp;rsquo;s day, however how it worked was not sustainable. The hashing was performed only haver uppercasing and splitting the password into two 7 character chunks. This meant that even if your password was 14 characters long, it was still technically only two 7 character passwords, that could be cracked separately.</description>
