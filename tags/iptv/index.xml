      <description>So, it&amp;rsquo;s over. ShmooCon and the meet up is finally over. I had a blast, but it put a tax on my time like you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what life is like for the Shmoo group, especially Heidi. I will be posting all of the pictures on flickr shortly. I got to do a lot of other things at ShmooCon other than just the meet up. I had the distinct opportunity to help bag over 1000 bags with swag, Shmooballs, and adverts.</description>
