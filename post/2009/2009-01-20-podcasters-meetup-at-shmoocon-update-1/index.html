<pre><code>Have a talk that didn't get accepted? Want the chance to share a project that you are working on? Think of FireTalks as a verbal blog post. The human experience is built on the ability to tell and learn from stories. At SchmooCon 2009, “FireTalks” is a supportive environment in which to either share insights or learn from others. Whether polishing a presentation (story) for conferences, meetings or training, FireTalks are the way to share, learn and improve. The inaugural FireTalks take place Friday night -- following the Podcasters Meetup. Talks are limited to 10-15 minutes with four (4) scheduled talks and four (4) open slots. Open slots will be filled on a first come, first serve basis. Saturday night will be more relaxed. Come join us and present, listen and learn. When Friday and Saturday Night at ShmooCon ‘09 Where ShmooCon 2009, in or around the press room
