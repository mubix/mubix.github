      <description>I went to see The Transporter 2 tonight. Normally I watch movies using an ‘alternative’ method, but for action movies it is really hard to get into it without the 13 speakers blaring heart pumping music into your face for a eyeball warping experience. I have to admit, that this movie was great, but if it had not been for the fantastic sound effects, music, and overall audible feel to the movie, I would have thought less of it.</description>
