<blockquote>
<p>Dreams without goals are just dream that are ultimately fuel for disappointment. On the road to achieving your dreams, you must apply dicipline, but more importantly consistency, because without commitment you&rsquo;ll never start, but without consistency, you&rsquo;ll never finish.</p>
