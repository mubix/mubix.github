  <h1>Offensive Security Live Courses for 2009</h1>
  <h2></h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <p>I highly recommend both of these courses, and the chance to get in front of the instructors and ask questions live is worth it IMHO. So bang on those manager doors and work it out, because seats fill quickly and they are limited. </p>

<p><strong>Check out the **[</strong>Offensive Security - Instructor Lead Training<strong>](<a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/ilt.php">http://www.offensive-security.com/ilt.php</a>)</strong> page for updated information.**</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are excited to announce our next Offsec Live Classes.</p>

<p><strong>Offensive Security Cracking the Perimeter Live<br />

$5000 now till July 30th<br />

<p>This class is designed for the seasoned security professional - A pentester or sec pro that has taken their skills to the edge and now need a little push over – to learn insane ways to crack the perimeter.</p>

<p>This class relies heavily on the student knowing and using Olly Debugger, the Metasploit framework and understanding if not having written an full blown exploit before attempting this class.  If you have taken the “Pentesting With BT” class and mastered all aspects of this class you might be ready to take Cracking the Perimeter.</p>
