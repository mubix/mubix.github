      <description>Meterpreter’s STDAPI extension (the one that always gets loaded) has a new command. This doesn’t happen very often so it’s worth noting.
The new command prints out the currently attached “mounts”. In windows world, that means the normal CD ROM, C drive, etc, but it also means all of the mounted network drives as well.
This gets very interesting when you happen to find yourself in a VM environment where you can start writing files to the host:</description>
