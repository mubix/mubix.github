      <description>My talk today at Wild West Hacking Fest was about some documents that I released here. I&amp;rsquo;ll make this blog post more indepth later but for right now I wanted to get the slides out.
(If you can&amp;rsquo;t access one of the documents yet, don&amp;rsquo;t ask for permission to do so, it just means either they aren&amp;rsquo;t ready yet, I&amp;rsquo;ll make posts about each one as they become available)
Here is the main slide deck for the docs: https://bit.</description>

      <description>Each year I make up a list the week before Blackhat and Def Con of talks that I &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t miss&amp;rdquo; and some that I want to see (and use it for video watching afterwards for those I missed). This year I thought I would share that list here. I will be breaking them down by each day of the events by time slot. Any talk I have a :star2: by, is a &amp;ldquo;Must see&amp;rdquo; for me.</description>
