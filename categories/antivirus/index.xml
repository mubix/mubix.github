      <description>Ever set up a multi/handler and get an odd IP hitting it? Probably forgot about it as internet chatter? Think again, you might have just been caught
AV Tracker - http://avtracker.info/ is a site that tracks the different IP addresses, hostnames, computer names and user agents that AV and other &amp;ldquo;Submit-your-malware-here&amp;rdquo; drop boxes use.
Peter Kleissner and his team provide
 ranges that the hosts use a dynamic text file with the IP addresses listed if you want to add it to some auto updating block list a line by line IPTABLES block config and even C code to add into your binary to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk out from one of those addresses (I could be reading it wrong, still a beginner in C)  The team has been criticized a lot by AV vendors, enough so the took down the site in January of this year.</description>

      <description>*WARNING* if you use fgdump like I did, it extracts pwdump to %TEMP% at run time, which is detected by AV.
First of all, I was floored when this worked. Really AV? It&amp;rsquo;s that easy? Really?
So here is the break down, go get &amp;ldquo;Resource Hacker&amp;ldquo;â€¦ You&amp;rsquo;re almost done. Only 3 steps left. (1 of which is optional)
I started with fgdump, a well known hashdumping/pwdump tool. It&amp;rsquo;s detected by 80% of all AVs and by all the top 10.</description>
