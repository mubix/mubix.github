<p>I know what you're thinking, cool, but no big deal right? It goes to twitter, and not to a feed that someone can subscribe to. You're right, and I fought all day trying to figure that part out and finally came up with a twitter search for my tweets and a special hashtag I would use for my shared links. I found the RSS feed for that search and it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?q=from%3Amubix%20%23SharedLinks">http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?q=from%3Amubix%20%23SharedLinks</a></p>
<p>obviously, this isn't the easiest or pretty link to send around, so instead I pumped that into Feedburner and now have this for a feed link:</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/MubixLinks">http://feeds.feedburner.com/MubixLinks</a></p>
<p>Much easier to share, with one AMAZING added bonus. I can switch the feed that powers it at any time, so from now on, no matter if I use Tumblr or Google Reader (after they unjack themselves) or G+ (if they finally set up a feed for +1'd items), that will always be the link to items that I've personally liked and wanted to share.</p>
<p>I encourage you to do the same, and leave a comment, so that I can follow your feed back!</p>
<p>Oh, and sign up for Buffer here (w/ my referal link ;) <a href="http://bufferapp.com/r/7e450">http://bufferapp.com/r/7e450</a></p>
