      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009 the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jeltel.com.au/2009/11/interview-with-ikee-iphone-virus.html&#34;&gt;ikee&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; rick-rolling worm went around the iPhone world via the password of &amp;lsquo;alpine&amp;rsquo; on the root account. You are now warned to change your root password when you pop into Cydia and Rock the first time. But this thing just wont stay down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have jailbroken your iPad you might want to check out a little file called &amp;ldquo;master.passwd&amp;rdquo;. In it, there is another user called &amp;lsquo;mobile&amp;rsquo; which has been pointed out since 2008 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20080224231344798&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) on the iPhone as another account to change the password of. But the media and Cydia/Rock warnings only put emphasis on &amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many iPad and iPhone apps STILL do not use the &amp;ldquo;keyring&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; and store your password in plain text or somewhere in a binary file (still plaintext), which the user &amp;ldquo;mobile&amp;rdquo; has access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[](/images/postimages/201008_jailbreak_1.png)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, &amp;ldquo;so what&amp;rdquo; you say. Since this recent jailbreak was using a website, the individuals running that site now have the IP address of freshly jailbroken iPhones and iPads. I am certainly not saying that they have any ill intentions, but sites have been broken into before, and that would be one hell of a gold mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully AT&amp;amp;T has put in blocks of some sort so that it&amp;rsquo;s customers are protected, but who knows what the other countries around the world that carry iPhones are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the very least, if you have jailbroken your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, please.. please set your passwords accordingly and do not have it a simple dictionary password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, you ARE giving up some security when you jail break your phone. It is on you to make sure that you lock what you can back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change your password, use &amp;lsquo;Terminal&amp;rsquo; and log in to one account at a time and issue the &amp;ldquo;passwd&amp;rdquo; command. You can also just log in to root and issue the &amp;ldquo;passwd mobile&amp;rdquo; command to change the password of mobile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; on 2010-08-09 19:39 by Rob Fuller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot of comments stating that OpenSSH isn&amp;rsquo;t installed by default and that this is not a big deal at all. A couple problems exist in that argument though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jailbreak is executing code on your phone/touch/ipad. Unless you do a analysis of the entire disk, you can&amp;rsquo;t be sure the jailbreak doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave some other way into the phone. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s a far fetched chance, but most users would never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t install it Out-of-the-box. There is a good possibility that you will OpenSSH at a later date. Better to get it fixed while you have it on the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
