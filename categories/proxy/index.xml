    <description><![CDATA[If you&rsquo;ve ever used proxychains to push things through Meterpreter, one of the most annoying things is its &ldquo;hardcoded&rdquo; DNS setting for 4.2.2.2, if the org that you are going after doesn&rsquo;t allow this out of their network, or if you are trying to resolve an internal asset, you&rsquo;re SOL.
