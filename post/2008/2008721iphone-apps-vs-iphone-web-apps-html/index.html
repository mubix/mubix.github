  <h1>iPhone Apps vs iPhone Web Apps</h1>
  <h2></h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <p>I am truely getting tired of iPhone &ldquo;Web Apps&rdquo;. I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone. They do have a pretty interface and I have to give props to some of the design developers, but does this seem more of a copout to anyone else?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give an example. I LOVE Remember the Milk. It is probably the best task system out there in my opinion. I have for the longest time tried to get tasks on my phone and have it integrate into my calendar. So I was very excited about the new iPhone and the possibility that there would be a killer app for calendar / todo syncing with the service I already love, RTM. To my shock I found they had a Web App. What does this do for me? I now can add tasks to my to do and RTM can email or text me when something comes up. I find this pointless, because I can simply add tasks with a full qwerty keyboard at the nearest computer with a internet connection. PLUS to add to it, RTM wants me to &ldquo;Go Pro&rdquo; in order to&hellip; use their WEBSITE? Hmm, pay 25 dollars and use their iPhone friendly web site, or just use their normal site from my iPhone&hellip;. I am not against paying for a product, and I am especially not against supporting a developer, but don&rsquo;t make me pay for VISITING YOUR WEB SITE.</p>

<p>I feel that a lot of these &ldquo;Web Apps&rdquo; are a complete waste of developers time, instead give me an ACTUAL iPhone App! Now, if Apple is charging all kinds of money to be published to the App Store than I retract all I have said. If not, you are missing the boat people, charge 9.99 a pop and make an iPhone app that is worth downloading. I promise that I won&rsquo;t be the only one pushing that &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; button.</p>
