      <title>Alive Again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a rather long hiatus from blogging. This is mostly because I was fed up with the blogging platform that I had (Squarespace) and didn&amp;rsquo;t really have any alternatives that met all of the features I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where am I at now? Github actually. Github allows users to create &amp;ldquo;Github Pages&amp;rdquo; for repositories (or be it&amp;rsquo;s own repo). For the most part these pages are written in Markdown. It&amp;rsquo;s late and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like looking up who, but someone created a project called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which is a Ruby based static page generator and then another project called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org/&#34;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; popped up using Jekyll to create a static html based blogging platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a pain in the butt to use and learn, but once you have a few things automated it gets simpler. It also hits the most bullet points of any other option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect things to pick up pretty quickly here, but as I&amp;rsquo;m typing this I&amp;rsquo;m already thinking that promising something like that is a bad idea. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes, it&amp;rsquo;s just good to be back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Problems with blogging software</title>
      <link>/post/2013/2013-08-10-problems-with-blogging-software/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Problems are that everyone does this whole blogging thing in so many different ways. Me, personally? I like to have a client that I can save drafts it, work on things a little bit here and there and then finalize stuff when I&amp;rsquo;m ready to post. I have a couple dozen of these posts ready and set with final tweaks needed but my blogging software Squarespace up and moved on to &amp;ldquo;Squarespace 6&amp;rdquo;. The the current stage you don&amp;rsquo;t have to move to 6 but at some point the owners of Squarespace are going to force everyone over. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait for that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Octopress and Postach.io are my favorite options right now. Both blog in markdown language which is ok. Converting 8 years of blog posts to markdown is going to be a lot of work but a one time deal. Plus it would give me a chance to go through and fix the things that were broken over the years of modified blogging clients and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postach.io has one major downside, they don&amp;rsquo;t have good &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; block support, whereas Octopress/Jekyll have excellent support as well code hilighting. The major upside? It&amp;rsquo;s based on Evernote. Which means I can blog from whereever I have Evernote. They also used to have an EXCELLENT feature that seems to have disappeared where if you updated a post it would automatically throw the blog post up to the top of your page, meaning your update would get back in your RSS feed and the update wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go unnoticed as most updates to blog posts do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was an honest idea to help identify people that might not get the media attention of other &amp;ldquo;Top X in Infosec&amp;rdquo; lists. But I should have known better than to put a poll on the internet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GPU Cracking Complaints</title>
      <link>/post/2011/2011-07-13-gpu-cracking-complaints/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2011 14:02:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2011/2011-07-13-gpu-cracking-complaints/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been cracking passwords for a while and use a myriad of tools in a certain order to get the job done. I find that Cain is still my Go-to for allowing me to visualize the process and do some basic sorting (really wish I could search in-app). But I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking around on twitter some questions like Why is GPU cracking for 50k hashes faster than Rainbow Tables (most say the bottleneck is the HDD read style and speed) and many asked what all of my compalints are so I figured this would be the best place (vice multiple emails)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/strong&gt;: I have very little crypto knowledge and even less GPU programming knowledge so I only get to complain as a user and not as someone who can actually fix the things I complain about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of LM support. I get that this is a complicated hashing algorithm, but the fact that 90% of companies still have it turned on and cracking any more than a few with Rainbow Tables is impractical unless you have a SSD raid with a GPU based cracker ($$$$$).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of dictionary support. Right now the best way to crack passwords is with oclhashcat-plus since it is GPU based and supports rules, multiple hashes (hash files) and directories of hashes. However, it has a very limited list of hashes it supports (No LM, SHA1, etc..) and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support dump formats, so you need to strip the file so it just has the hash (this is more of just a bother than a gripe).

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I say &amp;lsquo;The best way&amp;rsquo; because anything that has a key space larger than upper-alpha-numeric-32symbol (LM) is just a bit nuts to try and brute force out of the gate unless your goal is to &amp;lsquo;crack them all&amp;rsquo;. Me as a pentester, I want to get as many as possible, as quick as possible, so this means dictionaries are the smarter option. (Maybe later I can do the straight brute if I really need / want to)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of POT. For some reason every cracking app on the planet, save for JtR, thinks it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to crack the same hash multiple times. I wish even Cain would keep a secret store of all the hashes it&amp;rsquo;s cracked stripped of anything unimportant (need the salt (username) sometimes) and store it in the background so that if it comes across the same hash it can say &amp;ldquo;oo oo I know this one&amp;rdquo; and auto populate it even before I start cracking. Why more cracking software writers don&amp;rsquo;t do this I&amp;rsquo;ll never know (would make their software seem a ton faster the more it is used)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of formatting documentation (#ripshairout). Rare is the time I&amp;rsquo;ve found a cracking program that shows you how it wants to consume a hash. JtR is the most egregious offenders of this but they all do it. One would think people would try and make it easy for people to use their software (give examples of what shit is supposed to look like at least if you don&amp;rsquo;t support standard formats)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are my biggest gripes that the moment. If I am wrong on any account, let me know, I would love to know of a better way to do things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insider Threat Testing</title>
      <link>/post/2011/2011-01-27-insider-threat-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2011 15:41:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2011/2011-01-27-insider-threat-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/201101_insider_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This day and age everyone is worried about the insider threat. Internal Penetration Testing doesn&amp;rsquo;t really test what would happen if your janitor got paid 50 bucks to put a USB stick in one of your servers. External Penetration Tests are never scoped for that sort of testing. So what is a company to do? How can they know what the risk is? The answer? Usually they guess or assume. Mostly because they are scared to find out, it&amp;rsquo;s happened to them before, or one of a million different justifications. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a webinar coming up to describe exactly this type of testing, but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d go into it a bit here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI has a files upon files and stories stacked miles high about spies and insiders taking everything from accounting information (I could have put LIVES for effect but that&amp;rsquo;s more of a one-off) to staplers (no I don&amp;rsquo;t think Milton has an FBI file). Insiders throughout time have been the biggest threat to organizations even before sabotage and espionage became words. Ok, so what&amp;rsquo;s the big build up for? Simple. We need to build organizations up in the detection department from a pentesters point of view, not signature based. Our pentesters need to talk to our forensics guys, the incident responders need to talk to pentesters and every which way between. We are loosing this battle, and one of the reasons we are is we keep our bag of tricks to our selves, and that&amp;rsquo;s what insider threat testing is all about, getting all the tricks tested in a more open fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can your organization see a command and control session via IRC? What if it&amp;rsquo;s pushed over port 80? What about a standard meterpreter reverse_tcp connection? There isn&amp;rsquo;t a money based solution for this, just like there isn&amp;rsquo;t for phishing. Added on to all of the other things your security team does, there needs to be an employee, or a consultant that it is on the phone with your team saying &amp;ldquo;did you see this?&amp;rdquo;. Sort of like the &amp;lsquo;Can you hear me now?&amp;rsquo; test. I mean, have you ever met an incident response team that took time out of their day to see if they could get poison ivy (one of the most well known RATS /remote access tools/) through the firewall undetected? Probably, but when they came and told you about it you chastised them for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/201101_insider_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I&amp;rsquo;ve jumped around roles in this post a lot and I want to focus it back on getting true collaborative testing done, but there has to be a balance. If you&amp;rsquo;re staring at a piece of earth, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the ant walk on by, but you&amp;rsquo;ll probably miss a half dozen of them on your way to check the mail. So how do you do this? Why not make it an educational process? Have the senior staff on the phone with the tester, and then tell the junior guys something like &amp;ldquo;We just had a breach and it&amp;rsquo;s starting exfil data to this IP: x.x.x.x&amp;rdquo;. Give them a chance to find it then work through with them where / what happened, and why or why not any alerts or alarms went of and if they saw it in their normal flow. Ideally they spot it before the senior staff even mention it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this will not fit into the &amp;lsquo;I give you report you give me money&amp;rsquo; scenario. Companies should consider it a training exercise where they get instant and obvious benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other arenas this helps in too. For example phishing, you know how much harder it will be for an attacker to get a payload to work if you&amp;rsquo;ve already tested, detected and have traps (we&amp;rsquo;ll go into setting traps another time) for all the public avenues of C&amp;amp;C and exfiltration? They will get frustrated, and you&amp;rsquo;ll know that you&amp;rsquo;re being attacked. A proactive stance is what &amp;lsquo;testing&amp;rsquo; is all about, and this is a extremely neglected aspect of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one will solve &amp;lsquo;security&amp;rsquo;, all we are here to do is minimize the attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to the webinar to heckle, learn, or just hear more, or don&amp;rsquo;t. I just wanted to get this out there and ask the question: Can your most important data leave on a fake Lady Gaga CD without you knowing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Let me squash something real quick. No this is not a new idea. The prevention side is talked about ad nauseum, but hardly anyone talks about testing to see what could really happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jailbreak SSH horrors strike back</title>
      <link>/post/2010/2010-08-04-jailbreak-ssh-horrors-strike-back/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2010 04:30:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2010/2010-08-04-jailbreak-ssh-horrors-strike-back/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009 the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jeltel.com.au/2009/11/interview-with-ikee-iphone-virus.html&#34;&gt;ikee&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; rick-rolling worm went around the iPhone world via the password of &amp;lsquo;alpine&amp;rsquo; on the root account. You are now warned to change your root password when you pop into Cydia and Rock the first time. But this thing just wont stay down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have jailbroken your iPad you might want to check out a little file called &amp;ldquo;master.passwd&amp;rdquo;. In it, there is another user called &amp;lsquo;mobile&amp;rsquo; which has been pointed out since 2008 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20080224231344798&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) on the iPhone as another account to change the password of. But the media and Cydia/Rock warnings only put emphasis on &amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many iPad and iPhone apps STILL do not use the &amp;ldquo;keyring&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; and store your password in plain text or somewhere in a binary file (still plaintext), which the user &amp;ldquo;mobile&amp;rdquo; has access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[](/images/postimages/201008_jailbreak_1.png)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, &amp;ldquo;so what&amp;rdquo; you say. Since this recent jailbreak was using a website, the individuals running that site now have the IP address of freshly jailbroken iPhones and iPads. I am certainly not saying that they have any ill intentions, but sites have been broken into before, and that would be one hell of a gold mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully AT&amp;amp;T has put in blocks of some sort so that it&amp;rsquo;s customers are protected, but who knows what the other countries around the world that carry iPhones are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the very least, if you have jailbroken your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, please.. please set your passwords accordingly and do not have it a simple dictionary password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, you ARE giving up some security when you jail break your phone. It is on you to make sure that you lock what you can back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change your password, use &amp;lsquo;Terminal&amp;rsquo; and log in to one account at a time and issue the &amp;ldquo;passwd&amp;rdquo; command. You can also just log in to root and issue the &amp;ldquo;passwd mobile&amp;rdquo; command to change the password of mobile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; on 2010-08-09 19:39 by Rob Fuller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot of comments stating that OpenSSH isn&amp;rsquo;t installed by default and that this is not a big deal at all. A couple problems exist in that argument though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jailbreak is executing code on your phone/touch/ipad. Unless you do a analysis of the entire disk, you can&amp;rsquo;t be sure the jailbreak doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave some other way into the phone. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s a far fetched chance, but most users would never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t install it Out-of-the-box. There is a good possibility that you will OpenSSH at a later date. Better to get it fixed while you have it on the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Vuln Disclosure Summarized</title>
      <link>/post/2010/2010-04-29-vuln-disclosure-summarized/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have an admittedly limited view of the exploit dev world. However, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen devs have very few options: (Please correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;responsible-disclosure&#34;&gt;Responsible Disclosure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct Contact =&amp;gt; depending on the size of the vendor and their view on security, this could result in anything from a simple thanks, a reward, to a court hearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploit Broker =&amp;gt; possibly sell, possibly not, depends on the broker. The vuln could die on the table or stolen due to too much information being given during negotiations. This route has the same financial risk as direct contact, but a lot less risk of getting sued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZDI (or other vuln clearing house) =&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;instant&amp;rdquo; cash, but admittedly less than an Exploit Broker could possible get based on the financial risk to ZDI. Close to zero risk of court time (they may come after you for selling the exploit). And a lot less financial risk since (IIRC) they pay up front. But then the vulns go to also undisclosed parties, potentially the highest bidder which is probably not the vendor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; secretive groups who share vulns for different reasons&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just to friends =&amp;gt; No cash, no judicial risk, but you do risk them stealing/selling your exploit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-disclosure&#34;&gt;Full Disclosure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posting it to the web for all to see/user =&amp;gt; Possible court time, but the definite upside is the vendor is forced to react. A very quick way to make enemies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Releasing at a conference =&amp;gt; Probable court time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-disclosure&#34;&gt;No Disclosure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping it to yourself =&amp;gt; Working under the assumption that your the only one that has found that same bug is still semi relevant due to the incredibly small size of the exploit dev community. However, as Dave said, they&amp;rsquo;ll be toasting to their sleeping dead 0days some day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-more-free-bugs&#34;&gt;No More Free Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My stance on this is split, while I think people should get paid for their work, I relate this movement to mowing someone&amp;rsquo;s lawn and then ringing their doorbell and asking for money. However I&amp;rsquo;m sure Robert Graham&amp;rsquo;s punch in the face metaphor also works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, I have stated above, I am far and away a newbie to the vuln disclosure world and this debate has been going on since before I owned my own computer, but with the brilliant minds working at it, why doesn&amp;rsquo;t anyone offer up a solid solution to it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution? Create a standard, something that we all abide by. I know as hackers we rebel against such things but in the interest of getting better security out there (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s what we are here for right?&amp;hellip;. right?) we should should really work together on this. What sounds right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, what is the right way to approach someone who&amp;rsquo;s lawn you&amp;rsquo;ve mowed for the work you have done? Maybe free for open source projects, and a price based on exploitability and market share of the affected product?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Security (CAN BE) an ART not a SCIENCE</title>
      <link>/post/2010/2010-01-26-security-can-be-an-art-not-a-science/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is far from a new idea, however it&amp;rsquo;s not something that is easily provable. So I had an idea this morning. I posed the following question on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/201001_art_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what I got in return? a resounding &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; from everyone. (well I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/falconsview/status/8235524239&#34;&gt;one outlier&lt;/a&gt; but, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t when you are trying to apply science to prove art) I challenge you to name another non-artistic career that people are so passionate about that they would stay in it even if they won the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few that I would like to highlight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/schuetzdj&#34;&gt;@schuetzdj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/201001_art_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TomSellers&#34;&gt;@TomSellers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/201001_art_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ethicalhack3r&#34;&gt;@ethicalhack3r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a somewhat surprising outcome. See a trend? Most people wanted to quit their jobs, and start their own infosec company. Why is this? Is it just &amp;ldquo;The American Dream&amp;rdquo; or is it because they are unhappy with the current people in leadership? Or is it simply the fact that they are hindered from actually pursuing and learning hacking/security at work? The world may never know, but I do implore firms to look at the retention rate of their &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; talent. (No, I don&amp;rsquo;t buy into the No Infosec Peep left behind bull).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a rumor that Google has a practice. 2 hours a day, you (an employee of Google) are REQUIRED to work on a project of your own, that is in no way indebted or owned by Google, even after completion. I can imagine the above answers would change if that were the case where they worked. If their employers fostered learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of Infosec / Hacking being an art, do we have our premadonas? Of course. But do we also have our Van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s and Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s? Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, time for a bit of a reality check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/daveshackleford&#34;&gt;@daveshackleford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ya, you have NO idea what you would really do with millions of instant cash. I think the number is some 80% of lottery winners go BANKRUPT in the first 10 years. This is because you, and EVERYONE you have ANY connection to, goes absolutely crazy. To the point that there are lottery winner support groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that people say it now, shows that they at least have the passion for the art. (or are just fronting)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some &lt;strong&gt;honest&lt;/strong&gt; answers to even out the tide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/shmoosr&#34;&gt;@shmoosr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I believe that hacking is a science, until passion adds the artistic fire to the mix. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what I think, draw your own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That&amp;rsquo;s another thing I love about this field, you are constantly challenged to draw your own conclusions, to think, to learn, to improve, to be… better)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed, LinkedIn has started allowing you to link your Twitter account to your LinkedIn account. So, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this (since I opted out), but apparently LinkedIn will kick your status updates to Twitter&amp;hellip; like when you get a new job&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop blaming the admins!</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-11-19-stop-blaming-the-admins/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 04:00:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-11-19-stop-blaming-the-admins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We (the security community) all know, and make fun of &amp;ldquo;Users&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Admins&amp;rdquo;. They are derogatory terms in our community. So much so, that they could almost be classified at curse words. (I can see the XKCD now: Security stick figure talking to IT stick figure. &amp;ldquo;You stupid A****&amp;ldquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I neither discount their &amp;ldquo;contribution&amp;rdquo; to making my day fun, I feel that a lot of people miss an even bigger threat: Policies and Procedures, or SOP (Standard Operating Procedures). Those words are virtual kryptonite to anyone in IT, more so to &amp;lsquo;security professionals&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what makes them a threat? Two thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone hates them so they are rarely updated (you know.. like Windows.. stay with me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since they are rarely updated, and sometimes even those that are, are written poorly, or actually create vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example lets make all the local admin passwords something really difficult and long, and… all the same so that we can easily administer every machine. This makes it to updates go smoothly and group policy… Oh wait… we don&amp;rsquo;t have those problems anymore (or at least they aren&amp;rsquo;t based on local authentication issues).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, policies and documented procedures are good things. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying they aren&amp;rsquo;t. What I am saying is that when those documented procedures and policies that we blindly follow because the guy that trained me said so, just doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admins: Challenge that policy, find out the reason why you do what they want you to do. The worst that could happen is you could learn something new. The best is that you could change your company&amp;rsquo;s security posture for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security Pros: Time to get off your A**** and update the wiki! (or the doc/site/binder) so that your predecessor, or someone new to your team can hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also challenge you to look at internet policies/procedures… oh wait.. they call those features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>APPLE: A Modern Day Willy Wonka Story</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-10-12-apple-a-modern-day-willy-wonka-story/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I just called everyone who works at Apple an Oompa Loompa, but I digress:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading Brooke Crothers&amp;rsquo; story on the Apple &amp;lsquo;gag&amp;rsquo; order [1] and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of how Apple has created an almost similar situation. Everyone wants to know what Apple is up to, can&amp;rsquo;t stop talking about it. Buzz Out Loud [2] even had people call and email asking them to see if they could do a show without mentioning Apple or the iPhone. According to Brooke&amp;rsquo;s article, people are afraid for their very jobs (pun?) even in the mentioning of Apple. What&amp;rsquo;s behind the curtains at Apple? Is Steve Jobs going to send out 5 golden Apple Tablets? Probably not, but I can&amp;rsquo;t shake the image of Steve coming out on stage to do one of his presentations with a cane and doing a fake fall to the podium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I pose this crucial question to you, the reader: Who plays the part of Slugworth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10372535-64.html?part=rss&amp;amp;subj=news&amp;amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20&#34;&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10372535-64.html?part=rss&amp;amp;subj=news&amp;amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been debating making this kind of post for about a week, and I apologize for the RSS spam. But it was getting a bit repetitive telling people via DM, email or other communication what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I took my hiatus from Twitter, I zero&amp;rsquo;d out my followers, so, if you care to, please check to see if you are still following me. I will be watching my follows closely and will refollow people I might have missed in my initial run through.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Corrections and Questions about Nessus on Securabit</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-09-16-corrections-and-questions-about-nessus-on-securabit/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2009 17:52:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-09-16-corrections-and-questions-about-nessus-on-securabit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; I can&amp;rsquo;t say with 100% certainty that Nessus ever used NMAP as it&amp;rsquo;s base scanner, I was going off of memory. I apologize for not being perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2&lt;/em&gt; Since people can&amp;rsquo;t seem to let it go, I would say that I was totally wrong and the nmap was absolutely never used in nessus ever, but then I would be caught in another absolute that I can&amp;rsquo;t confirm. According to their wiki, the nmap nasl script were taken out because people were No, I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to the latest episode of Securabit in which Paul comes on and talks about Nessus. If he states in there that nmap was never the port scanning engine for nessus, then please go bug him if you think he is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 3&lt;/em&gt; Ron Gula of Tenable has confirmed via email that Nessus has never used nmap as it&amp;rsquo;s base scanner. Also, Attrition.org posted a bit of history on the subject: &lt;a href=&#34;http://attrition.org/misc/ee/nessus_and_nmap.html&#34;&gt;http://attrition.org/misc/ee/nessus_and_nmap.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.securabit.com/&#34;&gt;Securabit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.securabit.com/2009/08/25/securabit-episode-37-%e2%80%93-mapping-networks-with-fyodor-and-nmap/&#34;&gt; Episode 37&lt;/a&gt; - I made the statement that some people could be running nmap and not even know it. While this could still hold true, the context I put around it. &amp;ldquo;Nessus uses nmap for scanning&amp;rdquo; showed my years a bit. That statement is now a falsehood. Nessus uses it&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;optimized&amp;rdquo; port scanner. I put quotes around the word &amp;ldquo;optimized&amp;rdquo; simply because I don&amp;rsquo;t know what tweaks that have been done. Paul Asadorian from PaulDotCom Security Weekly sent an email into Securabit letting us know of the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the news very gallantly, but Paul was nice enough to lay out how someone would go about using nmap with Nessus these day. Those steps are pretty drawn out too, which I find kinda disheartining that not only do you not have nmap as your base port scanner, but the NASL scripts to use nmap are no longer included in the base install of Nessus (according to Paul, I haven&amp;rsquo;t confirmed that, but he does work for the company). And who knows why they decided to leave those script out, but you will have your chance to ask those questions because Paul will be on Securabit LIVE tonight to tie up any loose ends and talk about Nessus tonight at 8 PM EST (September 16th 2009).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simplicity is Security</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-08-13-simplicity-is-security/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2009 15:30:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-08-13-simplicity-is-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Per the best of the best in presenting, what breeds a good presentation slide deck? Simplicity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to pose a statement. &amp;ldquo;Simplicity is Security&amp;rdquo;. The reason I say this is that this day in age, at least in the US, &amp;lsquo;convenience&amp;rsquo; is king. And we try to protect those conveniences with &amp;lsquo;security&amp;rsquo;. Let me start over a bit, this train of thought all started when I started to explain the insecurities in WiMAX to my wife. We saw a WiMAX device that plugged straight into your computer. I told her this was bad because by connecting to this you have no barrier between you and the &amp;lsquo;bad guys&amp;rsquo; other than possibly the Windows Firewall. Her answer surprised me. &amp;lsquo;So?&amp;rsquo; is all she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan doesn&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;lsquo;Check Cards&amp;rsquo; or even really credit cards for that matter. To get such a card you need to go through a book worth of paper work, so it&amp;rsquo;s just not &amp;lsquo;convenient&amp;rsquo; for most people, so they don&amp;rsquo;t get them. So guess what? They don&amp;rsquo;t bank online, and they don&amp;rsquo;t buy stuff online. I racked my brain to figure out what possibly could be on her computer that a &amp;lsquo;bad guy&amp;rsquo; would want. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything (maybe you can). The government relies on paper backups of anything electronic (so they hardly make electronic versions). Signatures are based on stamps that are difficult to copy. The worst a hacker could do on her computer is use it as a zombie, and even then, their ISPs detect and disconnect excessive use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did we as &amp;ldquo;Security Professionals&amp;rdquo; go wrong? Was it the fat paychecks we wanted? Was it the fear of the &amp;lsquo;underground&amp;rsquo;? Reality seems to dictate that we will continue on this path from the analog to the digital, from paper and clerks to networks and AI. The question I want to ask you though is; Should we continue down the path of &amp;ldquo;MORE SECURITY&amp;rdquo; or should we deviate a bit for simpler, possibly non-technical practices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these last two posts you may assume that I favor the Japanese culture and way of life over a US one. You would be mistaken, I simply learn, take the best parts of what I learn, and try to apply them where I can. Learning from others triumphs and defeats, strengths and weaknesses is a basic human function that we a humanoids should embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applied Network Security Density</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-08-12-applied-network-security-density/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2009 15:30:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-08-12-applied-network-security-density/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently visited Tokyo, Japan. Just as always, my curiosity got the best of me and I started to calculate the population density of the buildings where I was staying. Giving fudge factor of non-populated apartments, I estimated 8,500 families in twelve 15 story buildings, living in a 1.5 mile square piece of land.That&amp;rsquo;s CRAZY. Mass transit and unrestricted modes of transit are not a whim, they are a requirement. I bet you&amp;rsquo;re asking how this applies to security, or for that matter computers at all. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t. But one of it&amp;rsquo;s effects does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an effect of this density, the Mom &amp;amp; Pap stores businesses flourish. In it&amp;rsquo;s density, the &amp;ldquo;big iron&amp;rdquo; is just too inconvenient, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. I used the reference for a reason. It was my own mental bridge between the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; and security world (anyone who denies the difference is confused, and/or just left DefCon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the &amp;ldquo;Big Iron&amp;rdquo; in the security world? Central management, Correlation, and other ways of supposedly spending &amp;ldquo;less&amp;rdquo; on security by having less points of failure. So this is where I stray from the path. I think that networks need to mimic their worldly equivalent. Large organizations need to take an page from Tokyo and decentralize. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s hard getting &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; people, and trust is not something we easily come by in this industry, but from an offensive point of view, centralization just means a bigger payoff. Higher walls, maybe, but an &amp;lsquo;easier&amp;rsquo; target to zero in on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? I eluded to it a bit in my previous paragraph, but what it means is more hands on. We need to train the &amp;lsquo;security guards&amp;rsquo; of our network and put them at every location we have a grouping of nodes. The smaller the grouping of nodes the better. VLANs are not enough. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the the dreaded &amp;ldquo;Defense in Depth&amp;rdquo; phrase: We need to make our defense in depth smaller, more compact. Make it to the point where you don&amp;rsquo;t NEED &amp;ldquo;Big Iron&amp;rdquo; because you have such small perimeters that open source stuff on an old *nix box would work just fine. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an exaggeration but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every city is different and unique, as is any network, and I am by no means saying that decentralization is for everyone. What I do think is that big organizations are getting too hung up on devices and one stop shops where they can set up a NOC and expect a number, however many, of people to be able to watch everything going on. Exactly the way that corporations lose touch with their employees because of their size, they are loosing touch with their network and how it works. How many places have you worked that they have a good diagram of nodes (not just subnets) on their network? Much less documentation on those nodes. How exactly are you supposed to centrally monitor something you have very little knowledge of? Will it take as many years as it did with personnel to reconnect with the life of the network? Probably, but I hope not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I am open to debate and hearing about flaws in my logic, so please leave a comment and tell me what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lies</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-08-12-lies/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2009 09:11:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-08-12-lies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was in middle school, I told a lie. I was so good at telling lies, and remembering even the infinite details of these lies that I could make them believable. Later in life, I learned that this skill was called “Social Engineering ;-)”, but back to the story; I told everyone that I had won a shopping spree at “Incredible Universe”, now named “Fry’s”. Even the teacher believed me. The kids made lists of what they wanted me to get for them, and I strung it on for way too long. You tell a lie like that though and you get caught eventually. As I did, and learned a hard lesson. At that time in my life I was going through some really rough waters, and having everyone “like” me for even that finite amount of time, helped me cope. Does that make it right? Definitely not. But I remember that experience to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why tell you all this? Because this post is both self serving (as it will make it impossible for me to lie about the following any more) and apologetic. I have lied to those I call friend. Recently these lies were told to some very good friends and I had my first physical reaction to the guilt of telling them. I was literally unable to eat that night. Enough stalling and making excuses here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a Marine Scout Sniper, nor ever been to Marine Scout Sniper school. I truly wish I had been and admire all those who have made it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never been to SEARS training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gentleman by the name of Fuzzy, was a gas attendant with me. Great guy, but he wasn’t an explosives expert in Okinawa to the best of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never met the Rock Marines of Korea, or for that matter trained with any other foreign military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never been to a Masseuse school, but I give great massages, ask anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was never a bouncer in NY or lived there. Only been there twice on vacation, but love the city, and the Yankees (although I have no idea who plays for or owns the team) nor do I follow them, or for that matter any sports team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been a bartender, but it was for a base beach snack bar that I followed mix solutions on a printed paper for, so I know absolutely nothing about mixed drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never told these lies during an interview or any other formal means, but I have told them to friends and acquaintances. I would like to apologize to all of them, here and now. I originally thought I should email them, but decided this public forum was a better and a bit more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are the lies damaging to anyone but me? Did I have to tell anyone? No, not really. Would someone figure out that they were lies? There is a small chance. But that’s not the point. I try to be as brutally honest as I can with people, and I want that to extend to things about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of me what you will, and I am deeply sorry if I misrepresented myself to you in any fashion at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me preempt this post with the following facts: I am a white male veteran with amazing parents. I went to a good school, and was never under-valued by the people I cared about. I fit no minority profiles in other words. I tell you this so that you can latch on to it as why I don&amp;rsquo;t understand anything in your rebuttal. But I think this gives me a unique view on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People are stupid. They will believe a lie because they want to believe it&amp;rsquo;s true, or because they are afraid it might be true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post was a long time coming. I feel pretty passionate about &amp;ldquo;my community&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t say that in a lead-follower sense, but more of a Kum Ba Ya one. The feather that pushed this post over the edge into existence is @&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/shazzzam&#34;&gt;shazzzam&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://demosthenes.tumblr.com/post/140922392/female-stereotyping-in-security-research&#34;&gt;Female stereotyping in security research&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which was in response to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackerschool.org/DefconCTF/17/B300.html&#34;&gt;Saphead&amp;rsquo;s Binary 300 solution cartoon&lt;/a&gt;. But please keep in mind, this only set the cogs in motion for this post that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about way before this cartoon came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sexism, and for that matter, any &amp;ldquo;-ism&amp;rdquo; is flawed on both sides. Now, Shazzzam went no where near the extreme that most of the &amp;ldquo;-ists&amp;rdquo; do for their &amp;ldquo;-isms&amp;rdquo;, she actually had some great points however, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t excuse the presumptions she made. Pusscat, Hypatia, and Shazzzam (+ the many other women in IT) have made enormous contributions, just as males have. Hackers are hackers. The only thing we measure by is the brain in your noggin, but I&amp;rsquo;ll go into that later. Where Shazzzam went wrong is that she assumed that this cartoon was depicting the female falsely, which may or may have not been the case. She then used it as a soap box to express her hate for people who make presumptions about her mental abilities because of her sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Damn men, &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; are always assuming I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between a WM (woman-Marine) and a hooker? Hooker gets paid in the morning and the WM gets paid on the 1st and 15th.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;mdash;-old Marine joke, origin unknown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a crude joke, it illustrates a point. During my time in the Marine Corps I witnessed female Marines that were useless, ones that slept around, and those that outshined their peers, male and female alike. But guess what, those that did well were sadly the minority in my experiences. Now you might hinge your argument on that it&amp;rsquo;s my biased opinion that &amp;lsquo;saw&amp;rsquo; what I wanted to see, and you very well could be right. I hardly consider myself perfect, but lets just say for the sake of argument that what I say is true. We all make assumptions, you are not perfect either, is it so wrong to bet on odds or experience when making assumptions? It&amp;rsquo;s human nature, but keeping an open mind is the key to this. How many Mark Dowds, HDs, Shazzzams and Pusscats are there in this world? How many times have you complained about an idiot boss or co-worker? How many times have you complained about script kiddies? or whatever you complain about on an assumption or amassed experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Stupid woman, &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; never do anything right, can&amp;rsquo;t even drive straight)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to my favorite part, and why I love our community. Hackers are hackers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;snip&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=7&amp;amp;id=3&amp;amp;mode=txt&#34;&gt;original - phrak&lt;/a&gt;)
We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(or sexual)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; bias&amp;hellip; and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it&amp;rsquo;s for our own good, yet we&amp;rsquo;re the criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can&amp;rsquo;t stop us all&amp;hellip; after all, we&amp;rsquo;re all alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+++The Mentor+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty of adding &amp;ldquo;(or sexual)&amp;rdquo; to this famous manifesto. But I think it stays in the spirit of it&amp;rsquo;s writer&amp;rsquo;s intent. This is my religion. I think all &amp;ldquo;ists&amp;rdquo; have forgotten what they fight for and just fight to be right. My suggestion? Make a mental note of those who have forgotten how to truly be what they claim as a title. For they will out themselves time and time again, and be destined to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Damn kids. They&amp;rsquo;re all alike.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rant Back – ValSmith</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-06-11-rant-back-valsmith/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2009 02:11:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-06-11-rant-back-valsmith/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Val Smith recently wrote a post on the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com&#34;&gt;Attack Research / carnal0wnage blog&lt;/a&gt; titled:&lt;br /&gt;
”&lt;a href=&#34;http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/node/361&#34;&gt;Security Conferences, pen tests and incident response&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my thoughts on what he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In paragraphs 2-6 he talks about two points. The first being that Hacker Conferences have become sort of commercialized with most speakers going for their day in the lime light or to pimp some product/0day. And the second being a lot of the talks are things that most can’t go home / back to work and test out or implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with him on both points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first point I think that one detail was left out of this evaluation. Size. Back when DEFCON was &amp;lt;500 people, almost everyone knew each other. 90% of those attending had the passion, had the fire for that what makes our line of work such an art. Now that our community has become “popular”, that percentage is around 20-30%. These numbers aren’t based on any stats, just something that I have been observing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second point, my first security conference was ShmooCon ‘06. I was glued to might seat in each talk I attended, and in just 3 short years I have seen EXACTLY what he’s talking about. I used to have to decide between awesome talks in the same hour. Now I actually find times where I’m not interested in anything being presented for that hour. But, rooms still get packed so I guess that’s just my own pickiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penetration Testing and Incident is the second portion of his post and I really think he’s hit the nail on the head, Pen Testing and Incident Response should work closely together. I want to throw Vulnerability Assessment and Forensics into the mix as well, feeding each other, sharing data, and assisting. The segmentation of duties / teams is killing collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets get back to the basics, and really show what this community is capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Manager Training Camp - Bootcamp Style</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-03-14-manager-training-camp-bootcamp-style/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2009 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-03-14-manager-training-camp-bootcamp-style/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/200903_manager_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Friday (March 6th, 2009) I posed the question above. What I got in return was nothing short of amazing, and to tell you the truth, it amazed me how the tally rounded out. I categorized the answers and counted them up (MANAGERS, listen up!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(12 votes) - Security Fundamentals: This category involves the application of A/V, IDS/IPS, basic safe surfing techniques, least privilege use, and an understanding of phishing. It astounds me that this is at the top of the list. I grouped all of these answers together because they truly are the BASICS of Information Security. Why after all these years have managers of security professionals not gotten this drilled into them to the point of bleeding? What are we doing wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(8 votes) - Targeting: &amp;ldquo;We aren&amp;rsquo;t a target&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;There isn&amp;rsquo;t anything on saying we are getting attacked&amp;rdquo;. This is another that surprised me to be at the top of the list. How can managers not think that 1. that they are a target, and 2. think that because there aren&amp;rsquo;t any alarms going off, they aren&amp;rsquo;t getting attacked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(6 votes) - Passwords: Complexity, not using stickies, rotation, etc. I left this out of Security Fundamentals, because it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy beast to over come. It&amp;rsquo;s something that definitely needs to be addressed and a plan set down for the application, enforcement and technology behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(6 votes) - Compliance and Policy: Everyone in this category made it abundantly clear that compliance to a standard does NOT mean that you are secure, but not at least making the compliance bar is worse. Internal policies need to be created to provide a stricter regimen then the compliance checklist demonstrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5 votes) - Accountability: From basic user to CEO and Security Analyst. Accountability has many faces but it usually shows none of them in the security world. Users of the world learn quick when one of coworkers get restricted access because they clicked test phishing  after they had just gone through phishing training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5 votes) - Defense In Depth: This is an old concept as well, but in recent years have been twisted to include DiD at host and network infrastructure level. The phrase Defense In Dept will continue to grow as the depths at which we can put protections on info systems grows. You need to realize that you ARE a target and you NEED to move with this evolution, not ignore it. Doing so doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it &amp;ldquo;go away&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3 votes) - Users are stupid: I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that this even made it as an item. Managers, you seriously don&amp;rsquo;t understand that your weakest link on your network is the users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2 votes) - Data Layer Protection: Encryption. Even if the client data is stored on a super &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo; data node, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean somewhere between point A and point B isnt&amp;rsquo; compromised. If it&amp;rsquo;s sensitive or secret, it needs to be treated as such at EVERY juncture where that data is transferred or can be accessed from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2 votes) - Risk Management: Managers, this is supposedly your specialty. Get back to it, they want you to be open to understand technically why this or that isn&amp;rsquo;t a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 vote) - Company buy-in: I am truly surprised this didn&amp;rsquo;t make the top of the list. I personally think that company buy-in to security should precede the rest of the categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simply a top 10 list of things we as Security Professionals want you to know. It would not be hard to create training in your organization around these 10 categories. If you are a manager or one of us, get it started, make the slides and start getting these topics nailed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have included the raw tweets from the poll so that you as managers can understand what your people want you to learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lorddrachenblut
&amp;gt; passwords dont go on post it notes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;taiyed
&amp;gt; The importance of protecting client data with encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oneeyedcarmen
&amp;gt; Compliance != Security&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clamasters - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.curtis-lamasters.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.curtis-lamasters.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; definitely not my quote but &amp;ldquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t measure it, you can&amp;rsquo;t improve it&amp;rdquo; Put that into security terms and make sure he understands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;techsnax - &lt;a href=&#34;http://techsnax.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;http://techsnax.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; that security means more than just passwords!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;strcpy - &lt;a href=&#34;http://strcpy.net/&#34;&gt;http://strcpy.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; that IDS is completely a flawed concept. Either that or firewalls are not an end-all solution for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tcrweb - &lt;a href=&#34;http://tcrweb.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;http://tcrweb.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; That users are the weakest link, convenience and security don&amp;rsquo;t always mesh well
_natron_ - &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.invisibledenizen.org/&#34;&gt;http://blog.invisibledenizen.org/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;/s/boss/client, layered security&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;armorguy - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/in/martinjfisher&#34;&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/in/martinjfisher&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;d be ecstatic if my boss understood defense in depth. &amp;ldquo;If we have A/V why do we need other endpoint products?&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;andywillingham - &lt;a href=&#34;http://andyitguy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;http://andyitguy.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; Management has to quit exempting themselves from security policies or others won&amp;rsquo;t buy into them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iamnowonmai
&amp;gt; Classifying data in containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;multimode - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chromedpork.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.chromedpork.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; Risk Management - Identifing the $ risk and priorization of tasks based on that risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;l3d
&amp;gt; defense in depth&amp;hellip; But i don&amp;rsquo;t have this issue, thank god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ilovegarick
&amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;d have all my co-workers understand not to open email attachments from unknown senders and not to forward them on either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;multimode -&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chromedpork.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.chromedpork.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; And accuracy in the presentation of those risks to peer and upper management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mortman
&amp;gt; but !compliant == !secure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ramblinpeck
&amp;gt; Ill replace boss with clients, but actually understanding AND using a real least privilege model would be great step for everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DFrain - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brinkmasterj.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.brinkmasterj.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; @ Compliance as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sintixerr - &lt;a href=&#34;http://sintixerr.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;http://sintixerr.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; That security is only tangentially related to technology&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;multimode - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chromedpork.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.chromedpork.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; Becuase an unsuccesful phishing email is often put way higher on the list then patching critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tnicholson - &lt;a href=&#34;http://nicholsonsecurity.com/&#34;&gt;http://nicholsonsecurity.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; That people (good/bad) are the weakest link regardless of policies or security related technology. Educate users about security!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cyberhiker - &lt;a href=&#34;http://howisthatassuranceevidence.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;http://howisthatassuranceevidence.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; The parts of infosec that make you secure are not the parts that are sexy or come from a vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;post_break - &lt;a href=&#34;http://iamthekiller.net/&#34;&gt;http://iamthekiller.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; The notion that forced password changes tend to be more of a security risk rather than a security method. (unless someone got fired)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cloudchaos - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cloudchaos.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.cloudchaos.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; the need for a good password/phrases that are changed regularly. |&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techdulla - &lt;a href=&#34;http://techdulla.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;http://techdulla.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; That threats (specifically web threats) do not discriminate based on the size of your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;michaeldickey
&amp;gt; Hard question, and worthy of a blog post. I&amp;rsquo;d say &amp;ldquo;You &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have a security incident. Plan for it and plan to find it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RonW123
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;If you have responsibility for security, but have no authority, your role is to take the blame when something goes wrong&amp;rdquo; Spafford&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tottenkoph
&amp;gt; The importance of email and Internet use policies, they&amp;rsquo;re usually overlooked by password policies. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jaysonstreet - &lt;a href=&#34;http://f0rb1dd3n.com/&#34;&gt;http://f0rb1dd3n.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; Just because there is no perceptible change does not mean you are not being attacked. The better your security the less they notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChrisJohnRiley - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.c22.cc/&#34;&gt;http://www.c22.cc/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; Security testing is all well and good, but not following through to fix the issues makes the process a pointless exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MarcoFigueroa - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mafcorp.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.mafcorp.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; I would make my boss understand that spending less than 1% of the total gross of the company income on Security is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MarcoFigueroa - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mafcorp.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.mafcorp.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; This seems to be the norm, the ratio of percentage spent on security is always a huge difference in most companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dgeorghiou
&amp;gt; Security is only as good as the system&amp;rsquo;s weakest link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MarcoFigueroa - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mafcorp.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.mafcorp.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; @tnicholson We have a security awareness program. It makes them aware but they still get compromised. There excuse is I didn&amp;rsquo;t know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ddahlen - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.poorboys.tv/&#34;&gt;http://www.poorboys.tv/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; That even non-windows machines are vulnerable and targets for attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;timmedin
&amp;gt; Getting rid of the &amp;ldquo;we will never be a target&amp;rdquo; mentality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;slick0 - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.basenetradio.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.basenetradio.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; The importance of having an antivirus/antispyware solution in the office. I wish I were joking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bug_bear
&amp;gt; Antivirus is not a valid primary defense&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lorddrachenblut
&amp;gt; @slick0 and firewalls per machine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;richardebaker
&amp;gt; that one computer hooked to 2 networks is in fact a gigantic hole in the air gap security on a control net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lbhuston - &lt;a href=&#34;http://stateofsecurity.com/&#34;&gt;http://stateofsecurity.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; One concept: That threats can be identified by transactions with non-real services, accounts and things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CrucialCarl - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dontpanictech.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.dontpanictech.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; (cool topic) my concept: Ignorance is not a valid defense and will not make you any less accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;danphilpott - &lt;a href=&#34;http://fismapedia.org/&#34;&gt;http://fismapedia.org/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; One security concept: Never believe what a sales person says, always get independent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lorddrachenblut
&amp;gt; passwords dont go on post it notes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrianWGray
&amp;gt; the importance of PUBLISHED policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hmjgriffon
&amp;gt; stop wrting your password on a sticky note on your monitor, and stop making it 123456&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jodyfranklin - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elder-n00b.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.elder-n00b.org/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re still compiling the list how about long passwd != strong passwd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JosephDawson - &lt;a href=&#34;http://bitstop.ca/&#34;&gt;http://bitstop.ca/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; get your client to understand one security concept fully&amp;hellip; You can&amp;rsquo;t add security after&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curtw
&amp;gt; within the context of the organization, I&amp;rsquo;d say the importance of executive representation and project approve/deny power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replies sent to CORE Security&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ben_p - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thegeekzone.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.thegeekzone.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; @CoreSecurity I would love for him to understand that security needs a budget. We have a lot of good ideas but no dedicated resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ben_p - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thegeekzone.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.thegeekzone.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; @CoreSecurity Actually, they get that but it&amp;rsquo;s the people above them (with the checkbook) that need that realization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sonofshirt
&amp;gt; @CoreSecurity That Red Teaming and auditing are not synonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jason_nixon - &lt;a href=&#34;http://jasonnixon.net/&#34;&gt;http://jasonnixon.net/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; @CoreSecurity Patch management is proactive requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;spinzon - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottpinzon.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.scottpinzon.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; @CoreSecurity One security concept: that the threat is real. Too much security is done to a compliance checklist. Take it seriously, boss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;steveshead
&amp;gt; @CoreSecurity - that it only takes one &amp;lsquo;mistake&amp;rsquo; to bring it all down!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First I wanted to say, sorry for this and the last installment of Room362 being non-technical. They are topics that I feel strongly about and so felt impelled to share.One of the biggest problems in the world, IMHO, are people who have unfounded hate. This is compounded by the anonymity of the Internet. Allowing that hate to have no reprocussion or identity. Let me also say I have a deep respect for Free Speech, the depths of which I fear, few truly know. What I don&amp;rsquo;t have a respect for is people who abuse that right. It&amp;rsquo;s ultimately a respect of your fellow man/woman/it, that transends any nationality, race, creed, or color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know where I stand, let me step down to a slightly lower soap box. On my last post about ethics, I received a comment from an individual who posted under the guise of not only a false email and name, but also from a proxied address. They were on my side of the argument and were digusted with Dave&amp;rsquo;s. His/her/it&amp;rsquo;s post was pointed, rude, and had no constructive criticism or facts. It was deleted. It does not deserve a direct response. So I am issuing a response to all who tred here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of posts are allowed to flow on other forums, blogs, and mediums of the Internet. &lt;strong&gt;They WILL NOT be allowed here. Period. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think of me what you will, pompous, self righteous. I don&amp;rsquo;t care. I will keep my bit of the Internet clean how I see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I hope I demonstrated this fact already, but I want to reiterate it here. I will never delete comments on any side of any discussion I have here, even if I disagree with the comment. I enjoy debat and discussion. I am religous in my faith fight for free speech and it&amp;rsquo;s application on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have something to say fine. You better do it with respect or you can take your posts to slashdot, digg, or some other place. They won&amp;rsquo;t see the light of day here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ethics of Teaching Hacking</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-03-11-the-ethics-of-teaching-hacking/</link>

      <guid>/post/2009/2009-03-11-the-ethics-of-teaching-hacking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My recent post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;/archives/456-ozymandns-tunneling-ssh-over-dns.html&#34;&gt;OzymanDNS - Tunneling SSH over DNS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; caused a good friend, and someone I highly respect in the information security field, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/davehull&#34;&gt;Dave Hull&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://trustedsignal.com/&#34;&gt;Trusted Signal&lt;/a&gt;, to call me out on the ethics of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of lying to you, Dave, and to myself, I did not put any thought into the ethics of the post until Dave brought it up. Well, except for that auto subconscious RIGHT/WRONG check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have done a lot of thinking on it since Dave&amp;rsquo;s message to me, I came up with a number of reasons why the post is not unethical and a number of reasons why it was. So I am going to post my thoughts and would like to know what you think. I hardly think there is or ever will be a solid white line of ethics but lets see if we can discuss it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching people to do anything, is at it&amp;rsquo;s core, simply that. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them do it. The flip side of this coin will be in the unethical side so don&amp;rsquo;t get your Anti-NRA panties in a bunch yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://offensive-security.com/&#34;&gt;Offensive Security&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sans.org/&#34;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt;, C|EH (&lt;em&gt;no they don&amp;rsquo;t teach ethics even though it&amp;rsquo;s in the name of the cert&lt;/em&gt;), and all the other &amp;ldquo;Penetration Testing&amp;rdquo; courses are teaching hacking. The phrase &amp;ldquo;Penetration Testing&amp;rdquo; was created so that we could pass it off to our bosses as a needed service without scaring them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unethical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically in the post it is targeting Hotspots that charge money. Skirting this is illegal, and could land some jail time, or at least make you spend some time in airport holding, making you miss your flight. I did not put a disclaimer in the post, and I probably should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hak5 has a huge following of impressionable teens, who may or may not be mature enough to handle this information in the correct manor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, was the post unethical because it sounds like I put my stamp of approval on illegal activities? Would it have been more ethical with a disclaimer? Would have been more ethical without the targeting of hotspots? Should I take the post down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My decision after considering everything? To leave it up, while adding a disclaimer. It is not my job to raise the worlds kids with a solid basis of ethics, but it is my responsibility not to endorse illegal activity to those who follow my activity online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Dave, I look forward to your comments, and anyone else&amp;rsquo;s who would like to chime in on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2 Kindle or Not(ebook) 2 Kindle</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-03-05-kindle-or-notebook-2-kindle/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2009 20:19:12 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-03-05-kindle-or-notebook-2-kindle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been debating on whether to get a Netbook or the Kindle 2. (I am only in this debate because my lovely wife decided to buy a table and chairs, for the house. There is no winning when they buy things for &amp;lsquo;the house&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;the kids&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I tweeted up my dilemma and got a huge amount of responses. They came from both sides of the fence. Some said Kindle and some said Netbook, and they all had good arguments. But, being the gadget nerd that I am and having owned a netbook before I started to lean towards the Kindle. Until I looked at the Kindle store..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hear about the Kindle you hear about the cheap books (no argument there), the free EVDO (still no argument), and the fact that you can read blogs and magazines. This is where the marketing people caught me. I am a huge blog reader. I currently have 2700+ blogs in my google reader OPML (I can usually hit them all in less than an hour with a process I&amp;rsquo;ve refined, so don&amp;rsquo;t think too lowly of me). So the fact that I could read my blogs and the occasional book, and even send pdfs to the Kindle got me excited about the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the Kindle 2 in my shopping cart at Amazon, added a leather case just for S&amp;amp;G, and looked back at TweetDeck for any last comments people had. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/hmjgriffon&#34;&gt;@hmjgriffon&lt;/a&gt; was completely against buying the Kindle, so I decided to try out sending a PDF to the Kindle app Amazon has for the iPhone. I had installed it a couple nights ago and hadn&amp;rsquo;t tested it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the charges started rolling in. First I find out that it is 10 cents per PDF that I have converted for use on the Kindle/iPhone App. Then I looked into the blogs, you know, just to try at least SOMETHING out before I bought it. The few blogs that they support are either 99 cents or 1.99 a month. Wait.. so let me get this straight. I have to pay $1 or $2 to view a blog that is free? No thanks. I mean they could do something cool and special with the blog, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see the market. Magazines, maybe, I think I would probably subscribe to CPU or Linux Journal if it came via Kindle (definitely 2600..).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I stopped, and complained on twitter about it. Then a couple people started shouting solutions, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/wardspan&#34;&gt;@wardspan&lt;/a&gt; pointed me towards a Kindle book (and said it contained the secret to using Google Reader on the Kindle free):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Users-Amazing-Amazon-Kindle/dp/B001TOCCRK/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1236280910&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;The Complete User&amp;rsquo;s Guide To the Amazing Amazon Kindle 2: A Kindle Owners Toolkit Of Over 500 Tips, Tricks, &amp;amp; Links (For Amazons Revolutionary e-Book Reader &amp;amp; Free Wireless Web Browser) (Kindle Edition)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to purchase it (0.99) and read it on my iPhone, for not only the contents of the book, but to kind of gauge the service for myself before I buy. I think that 99 cents is a minimal cost to find out if the Kindle truly is for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps those of you who are on the fence like me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Twitter API Problem</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-03-04-twitter-api-problem/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2009 15:54:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-03-04-twitter-api-problem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/200903_twitter_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of you Twitterholics have seen this beautiful status. You get a total of 100 API calls per Twitter account per hour. What happens if you use all of your afforded calls? You can just use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.twitter.com/&lt;/a&gt; no problem right? Well you loose a lot of what makes Twitter clients so useful (search, grouping, instant updates.. etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, what if you leave you client up at home? TweetDeck by itself uses most of the API calls just by itself. So in this scenerio, you are destined (at least for that day) to spend it on the twitter site, which as we already discussed, leaves much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom taught me never to point out a problem without suggeting a solution, so here is what I think would be an awesome addition to Twitter, that might have other advantages as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/200903_twitter_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is at the bottom of gmail. It allows you to see where else your account is being accessed from (IP). You can also click &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo;  and click to log out of all other sessions. This would be nice in twitter for a couple reasons. It would allow you to block/logout the client you left at home, but also check to make sure the IPs that are accessing the API on your behalf are your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a suggestion..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My iPhone runs Windows</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-02-23-my-iphone-runs-windows/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2009 22:50:56 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-02-23-my-iphone-runs-windows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(This is the 3rd time I am writing this post, FF Fail, then Word crashed, so please excuse the lack of passion)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment that PDANet published that they released an updated version that allows USB tethering, I ran home and “QuickPWNd” my phone (which took all 5 minutes). Loaded the app and now I had the coveted TETHERING. I was free of my bind to Comcast or Free Public Wifi. However, over the next few months, my iPhone started getting slower and slower to respond. Crashes happened on apps that never had a problem before (including Safari). It would even crash on incoming calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 minutes ago (now more like 20), I had it crash again and slow responsiveness down to unbearable speeds. (2 minutes from touch to fully started app). When I had an internal debate: Would I go home and de-PWN it, or deal with it? With that same thought I realized that at the core of most of the technologies we use today, Windows, Twitter, MySpace (now Facebook), is an underlying need, freedom, or other feature that they provide that makes them ‘bearable’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter’s FAIL WHALE is famous because Twitter crashes or is down A LOT. Why do you still use it? Windows is an utter mess of code and BSOD even had a hardware device made for it. Why do you still use it? &amp;hellip;you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to revert my iPhone back. You know why? Because the freedom that it provides me, (like typing a blog post for the 3rd time going 65 miles an hour in the back seat of a car) is worth it, to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TiVo for the Economically Unstimulated</title>
      <link>/post/2009/2009-01-22-tivo-for-the-economically-unstimulated/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2009 17:40:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2009/2009-01-22-tivo-for-the-economically-unstimulated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TiVo and DVRs in general have brought TV watching a long way. Some of the innovations that have come of it have made the TV experience better.  Commercial skipping is my own personal favorite. But some of the other features are pausing, rewinding, and fast forwarding (after you are behind a bit obviously) and finally recording. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, recording live TV is nothing new. People have done it since VCRs were invented, and I’m sure much before then. But the problem, from back in the day, all the way up to the most updated TiVo is that you, the user have to remember to set it up to record, and if you missed an episode, you’re SOL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comes torrenting. Usually it’s a bad word on the Internet and on the news, so I will make my disclaimer here. I am not a lawyer, nor do I know the laws surrounding what I am about to describe. Use at your own discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using your favorite torrent search engine (mine is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scrapetorrent.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.scrapetorrent.com/&lt;/a&gt;) you can find every episode of every show you could ever imagine, even some of the more obscure ones. However we run into the same problem, you the user have to know when a new episode is out, hunt it down, and download it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where TVRss (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tvrss.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.tvrss.net/&lt;/a&gt;) shines and makes your life easy. TVRss is a website that serves up RSS feeds for a huge list of shows. You might not find some of the more obscure shows, like you would doing a naked torrent search, but they have most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where do all the pieces fit together? TVRss + uTorrent (or your favorite RSS supporting torrenting program) + your favorite media server/client of choice and you have a free TiVo killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifehacker has a tutorial on getting this running working with Democracy: &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/204057/&#34;&gt;http://lifehacker.com/204057/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will post screen shot here later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQLi through meta refreshes using cookies or useragents. Making SQLi a client-side attack. How much do you want to bet that the person that visits the site the most is the administrator :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Javascript adding hidden files upload form fields that are auto populated with &lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\Repair&lt;/code&gt; .. yadada. You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Speaking 102 - The Audience Perspective</title>

      <guid>/post/2009/2009-01-06-speaking-102-the-audience-perspective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/200901_speaking102_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was in a brief / talk / meeting and I just wanted to share with you some of the things that I saw in this event that might better help you know what NOT to do while getting up in front of any size crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death by bullets (Yes this is bulleted to be ironic). But seriously, this was a reoccuring theme throughout the meeting. Try and keep it to 3 or 5.
*Simple = Better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The slides should not be more important than the speaker. If your slides can be printed out and disbursed. Don’t waste the time of everyone attending by reading them or having us read them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the audience takes more than 5 seconds to read a slide = &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the speaker takes more than 2 seconds to read a slide = &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt; (this is only tolerable at the 2 second limit during long and information intense talks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your text during slide creation is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUTOSIZING DOWN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, you are in the &lt;strong&gt;process of FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visio is a hand out development tool. Using it as a slide development tool = &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding items in your hands without the items being on topic = &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt; (do not figit with a book, or a pen or an award until it is time to use said object)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrupting you co-speaker to enhance points = &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt; (this is _**NEVER **_a good thing) You are demeaning your co-speakers presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making it obvious that you were not paying attention to your co-speaker by stating that you don’t know something that was actually just presented by your co-speaker = &lt;strong&gt;MAJOR FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to get these off my chest as the speakers were not interested in input. I hope these help you become a better speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enterprise Security - Moving a Giant</title>
      <link>/post/2008/2008-12-20-enterprise-security-moving-a-giant/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2008 03:08:43 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2008/2008-12-20-enterprise-security-moving-a-giant/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday on Twitter I posed 3 questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mubix/status/1065403044&#34;&gt;Question 1&lt;/a&gt;: Now that Clickjacking has faded away from “Newest Greatest BAD STUFF”, how many implemented NoScript personally? What about Enterprise wide?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mubix/status/1065460884&#34;&gt;Question 2&lt;/a&gt;: Now, everyone who responded that you are still at IE in the enterprise. Why? Did you show the powers that be clickjacking and it’s effects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mubix/status/1065550153&#34;&gt;Question 3&lt;/a&gt;: Ok here is the final question of the trio, Why, since we rely on IE, aren’t we screeming at M$ to implement NoScript-like features?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrewhay.ca/&#34;&gt;Andrew Hay&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/andrewsmhay&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;), one of the crazy smart guys from the party house above the US posted a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrewhay.ca/archives/488&#34;&gt;great blog article&lt;/a&gt; (kinda redundant to say posted a blog post eh?) (and no that wasn’t a Canadian joke). And the following is my rebuttal to some of the things he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First he goes into training. And I agree with him for the most part. The support teams are going to need to be trained to support Firefox, but exactly how many calls do you really expect that to be? The address bar is in the same place, tabs work the same, as do bookmarks. Importing bookmarks is a rather simple process as well, FF does it by default on first use. I guess the only person who can answer this is someone who has actually made the move from one browser to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second he touches on money. I take a bit of a different approach to this. I think that they (Cx0s) should spend the money on the Mozilla Foundation to build an enterprise deployment package, including an addon (extension) deployment engine and GPO tie in. But as far as as the testing, Q&amp;amp;A, and support, if your company offers to work with Mozilla on an enterprise deployment, I am sure they will fall over themselves to help make it happen. Sure, there will be training to go along with the new deployment and management pieces, but most likely the people working with Mozilla to get it working will have such an indepth knowledge of the product by the time it gets rolled out enterprise wide that they will not need training. And finally, are you really telling me that any company on the planet pays to train all of their staff? In my limited experience it’s always been, send one, and he/she will train the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina&#34;&gt;Deus Ex Machina&lt;/a&gt;, when I first read this I instantly thought of the game &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eidosinteractive.com/games/info.html?gmid=50&#34;&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/a&gt;, but basically as Andrew put it, it’s explaining in business terms, what the threat / risk is, what the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.uncommonsensesecurity.com/2008/09/foi-failure-of-investment.html&#34;&gt;FOI&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp?viewed=1&#34;&gt;ROI&lt;/a&gt; is, and how the deployment can happen to the mangement (Cx0? Writers of the check, WOTC is much less sexy than CSO eh?). My answer to this is that I agree compeltely. Enterprieses, be it corporate or government, are like giants. They can see much farther (industry insight is usually the main job of a CxO), they are very slow making steps (changes of any size).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here is the tweak, I think when they do make changes, like giants, they are huge steps forward. And, Andrew is right again, it usually takes a dedicated individual in the organization to push it to the point where finally people start listening. That person is going to the be the least popular person in the buisness but at the end of the ordeal, he/she will most likely either become very high ranking in the organization, or another company will take notice of the game changer, and pull them into their company hoping for the same fighting spirit to help their company flourish. But then again, it could end much worse. Some companies are so set in their ways that they refuse change and will repremand those who push it too hard. Check out out &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.realitysecurity.com&#34;&gt;Marcus Carey&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.suntzudata.com/&#34;&gt;Sun Tzu Data&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.realitysecurity.com/2008/12/wall-e-security.html&#34;&gt;post that sums up Deus Ex Machinca in one image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, Andrew point out the Blind Eye technique. Ostriches play this game and it never really ends well for them. This is a base (I have started to hate the word “fundemental” sine the elections) difference between security pros in the biz, some if they don’t see a risk, or it wide spread in the wild, they don’t see a rush. Marcin from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tssci-security.com/&#34;&gt;TS-SCI Security&lt;/a&gt; made some twitter posts (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/marcinw/status/1067396301&#34;&gt;#1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/marcinw/status/1067399406&#34;&gt;#2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/marcinw/status/1067401112&#34;&gt;#3&lt;/a&gt;) making some valid points. Are they wrong? No, not all, it’s just a different approach to security. I am more optimistic than I think I should be, I see the potential for bad stuff to happen and I want to fix it immediately, because there are definitely bad guys out there that are much smarter than I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion to this already too long post, I think it’s a struggle, and we, as security people, will fight it forever. Cops have been hated since the dawn of time, and we are basically &lt;a href=&#34;/archives/250-Security-Guards-without-guns.html&#34;&gt;computer security guards&lt;/a&gt; right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me what you think, I am always open to being proven wrong, it’s then that we learn right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/200812_securityguard_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had this rant on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/mubix&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (if they had threading I would link to it). I have also had it in person a half dozen times at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.csiannual.com/&#34;&gt;CSI Annual&lt;/a&gt;. And a piece of it was touched on a piece of the puzzle by &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.uncommonsensesecurity.com/&#34;&gt;Jack Daniel on his blog&lt;/a&gt; posting “&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.uncommonsensesecurity.com/2008/12/fallacy-of-penetration-testing.html&#34;&gt;The Fallacy of Penetration Testing&lt;/a&gt;”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as “Security Professionals” have a big problem. We usually don’t have the power to make change. This has been a fight that every one of us has gone to bat for and usually lost. We are basically security guards without guns. We don’t have the ability to shoot that intruder if he trys to step up. Now, that is an over simplification, but you understand what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we all want the power, but are we ready for the consequences that such power brings? Are you ready to loose your job or go to jail if someone breaks into your network? Again, an over simplification, and I understand there are things outside the control of all of us, but if you implement security policyes, and products, and they fail, why do we just go ‘oh well, lets mitigate and try to catch them the next time’. I don’t think that the security community as a whole is ready for such power or the consequences it brings. I know this is going to be a very controversial issue, so fell free to post your comments. Tell me why you think we are ready for the guns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ego Surfing or Caring?</title>
      <link>/post/2008/2008-12-06-ego-surfing-or-caring/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2008 01:29:27 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2008/2008-12-06-ego-surfing-or-caring/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://garyvaynerchuk.com/&#34;&gt;Gary Vaynerchuk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tv.winelibrary.com/&#34;&gt;Wine Library TV&lt;/a&gt; made a post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://garyvaynerchuk.com/2008/12/05/ego-searching-or-caring/&#34;&gt;Ego Searching&lt;/a&gt;. He describes in this short video that ego searching when you are trying to make a brand is simply caring about your audience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe id=&#34;viddler-7a059729&#34; src=&#34;//www.viddler.com/embed/7a059729/?f=1&amp;offset=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;disablebranding=0&#34; width=&#34;545&#34; height=&#34;349&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now even &lt;a href=&#34;http://live.twit.tv/&#34;&gt;Leo Laporte&lt;/a&gt;, while being interviewed on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekcred.net/&#34;&gt;Geek Cred&lt;/a&gt; podcast said that as a broadcaster (which can be translated into “Content Producer”), your audience is the most important thing and your responsibility is to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in this post I will show you a way to ego surf efficiently, taking it to a whole new level to save you time, without sacrificing the interaction that Gary V. detailed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/200812_googlealerts_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets start with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/alerts&#34;&gt;Google Alerts&lt;/a&gt;. Google Alerts are a way to get an update whenever there is a new search result for a specific search. Instead of going on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogsearch.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google’s Blog Search&lt;/a&gt; every day or every hour, you can get an email whenever there is a new result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Terms&lt;/strong&gt;: Whatever your brand is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: This is where it starts to get interesting, choose Comprehensive and it will search blogs, news, regular google, videos and google groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Often&lt;/strong&gt;: As it happens, daily or once a week updates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver To&lt;/strong&gt;: You can either get it as an RSS feed or straight to your email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here is the slight problem with that. You will be getting updates every time you post anything. Lets add some google hacking to these search results so we can get the most bang for our buck:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, my search would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;link:room362.com -site:room362.com&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would give me results whenever someone has a link to room362.com on their page, except when it’s on my domain (room362.com). Now, if you are looking at branding it can get much more complicated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one of my searches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mubix -site:room362.com -site:mubix.blogspot.com -site:hak5.org -site:mubix.vox.com_&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This search gives me results whenever “mubix” is even mentioned except when it’s on one of the sites. And you can edit these results all you want. Upping your Google Fu is the name of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use Google Alerts for all kinds of things. Another one that I have is “Call for Papers”. I have made added a lot of Google Fu to that search so that it just does security gigs, so customize the searches to what you want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you want to take all of this to the extreme, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://alp-uckan.net/free/monitorthis/&#34;&gt;MonitorThis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Ego Surfing Caring,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gmail Snooze Button</title>
      <link>/post/2008/2008-11-29-gmail-snooze-button/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2008 06:41:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2008/2008-11-29-gmail-snooze-button/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/postimages/200811_gmail_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use gmail. Not really a big admission nor, very hard to find out. But the reason I use it is becasuse of it’s theading and archiving. For me those two abilities are unmatched anywhere else, both Outlook and Thunderbird fail horribly at this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to the point, I have reached a certain level of ‘zen’ with my GTD methods on gmail. I am in a constant battle for “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk&#34;&gt;Inbox Zero&lt;/a&gt;” and have “Starring” extremely useless for me. My problem lies in the fact that I have email threads that I am waiting on people to reply or I simply want to reply later. While keeping them in my Inbox is alright, it is a mental block in my quest for Inbox Zero to have to go to the next page of emails and work from there due to the first page being full of followups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I thunked on the problem and came up with the idea of a snooze button. I would like a snooze button in gmail where I can click a email thread, and it asks me for a date and time period and possibly a note to tag along with it. And then, on that date or elapsed period of time OR a new email enters the thread, the thread reappears in my Inbox. I realize that you can Star, then archive, and then check your stars, but that doesn’t work for me, it is simply like making a second inbox to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any ideas on how to make this happen or a contact at google that would be willing to listen to the idea, please leave a comment or shoot me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maltego Keygen Crack Torrent and Offensive Security Torrent</title>
      <link>/post/2008/2008-10-24-maltego-keygen-crack-torrent-and-offensive-security-torrent/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, and welcome to my trap. I see a ton of searches of just your type on my site on a daily basis. Lets get down to ranting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paterva.com/maltego&#34;&gt;Maltego&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome tool, it’s also GIVEN AWAY for FREE.. As in beer, which they allow you to use their servers to do your stupid little ego searches on.** STOP TRYING TO STEAL IT.**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.offensive-security.com/training.php&#34;&gt;Offensive Security 101&lt;/a&gt;. This is by far the best course / certification that I have attempted thus far in my career. It is informative and challenging. &lt;strong&gt;STOP TRYING TO STEAL IT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to sum up a bit and not sound like a total ass. I fully support the use of torrents, for many of it’s uses. I do not however support the torrenting of projects such as this. The Offensive Security people contribute day and night with the development of BackTrack 3, which is again, free. Paterva also gives away the use of their Community Edition of Maltego for free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of just taking from the community like the leech that you are, try contributing something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who frequent my blog, I am sorry, this rage is not intended for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/post/2008/2008-09-17-confusion-and-delay-/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to a PEBKAC error with the ID 10 T, I have had to retype parts 2 and 3, which were ready to go out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time while I fix myself, here are a couple sites that can keep you busy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search google for exploits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exploitsearch.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.exploitsearch.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch just about any TV show (and some movies) online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.surfthechannel.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.surfthechannel.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play any NES game online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virtualnes.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.virtualnes.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start a blog without any signup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.posterous.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.posterous.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Brass Tax on Chrome</title>

      <guid>/post/2008/200893brass-tax-on-chrome-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So there is already an exploit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&#34;&gt;http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are naysayers: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/&#34;&gt;http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is the truth: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html&#34;&gt;http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the design of the tabs and address bar, but I can do that with a theme in firefox. I want my add-ons, even with the memory problems. Chrome is great for Mom and Pap, but for “Internet Power Users” it falls lightyears short on features. So where is the brass tax?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox &amp;gt; (INSERT CHROME HERE) &amp;gt; Opera &amp;gt; Safari &amp;gt; IE7 &amp;gt; IE8 &amp;gt; IE6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Yousif Yalda has made it to the coveted “Stupid People” link category, where until now was solely held by Ashley Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the hits just keep rolling in:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently was Stumbling and happened across the following video. Now, when people use StumbleUpon they are usually bored and aren’t really contributing to the world as we know it. It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/post/2008/2008722comcast-cares-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after my last post, which autotwittered, I got a reply from a guy by the name of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=Frank+Eliason&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&#34;&gt;Frank Eliason&lt;/a&gt;, who goes by the handle “&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/comcastcares&#34;&gt;ComcastCares&lt;/a&gt;” on Twitter. And this is how the converation went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix: Blogged Comcast: The start of a new series &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/6jrvhe&#34;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/6jrvhe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 days ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix I would like to help. Email me *********[snipped]@cable.comcast.com (new email: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com?subject=I%20have%20a%20problem%20with%20comcast%20%20can%20you%20help%3F%20-%20Referred%20by%20Room362.com&#34;&gt;We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 days ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix: @comcastcares it shouldn’t come to the point where you need to help. I expect a certain level of service for the golf time I am paying for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;about 3 hours later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix The golf time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 minutes later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix: @comcastcares the premium that I pay monthly helps pay for Comcast execs trips to the golf course&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;about 1 hour later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix Oh! I have not been golfing in a long time. Actually I do not know any golfers here. I guess I should make more friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after I’m done insulting the guy, he still goes out of his way to help me out. The very next day after this twitter conversation happens, a “gumbling” as my wife put it, contractor came to my house and put the cable in the ground. So I would like to give notice to Comcast: Frank Eliason is the best employee you have, if he every leaves or gets fired, I’m switching providers. To those who have problems with Comcast and their customer support, click the email link above and Frank will fix any problem you have, or at the very least he will know who to contact and with get things actually moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Frank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone Apps vs iPhone Web Apps</title>

      <guid>/post/2008/2008721iphone-apps-vs-iphone-web-apps-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am truely getting tired of iPhone &amp;ldquo;Web Apps&amp;rdquo;. I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone. They do have a pretty interface and I have to give props to some of the design developers, but does this seem more of a copout to anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example. I LOVE Remember the Milk. It is probably the best task system out there in my opinion. I have for the longest time tried to get tasks on my phone and have it integrate into my calendar. So I was very excited about the new iPhone and the possibility that there would be a killer app for calendar / todo syncing with the service I already love, RTM. To my shock I found they had a Web App. What does this do for me? I now can add tasks to my to do and RTM can email or text me when something comes up. I find this pointless, because I can simply add tasks with a full qwerty keyboard at the nearest computer with a internet connection. PLUS to add to it, RTM wants me to &amp;ldquo;Go Pro&amp;rdquo; in order to&amp;hellip; use their WEBSITE? Hmm, pay 25 dollars and use their iPhone friendly web site, or just use their normal site from my iPhone&amp;hellip;. I am not against paying for a product, and I am especially not against supporting a developer, but don&amp;rsquo;t make me pay for VISITING YOUR WEB SITE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that a lot of these &amp;ldquo;Web Apps&amp;rdquo; are a complete waste of developers time, instead give me an ACTUAL iPhone App! Now, if Apple is charging all kinds of money to be published to the App Store than I retract all I have said. If not, you are missing the boat people, charge 9.99 a pop and make an iPhone app that is worth downloading. I promise that I won&amp;rsquo;t be the only one pushing that &amp;ldquo;Purchase&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t like to publicly bad mouth companies, but at some point, Comcast’s lack of “service” has got to stop. Well, let me rephrase that: Comcast needs to be held accountable for their utter lack of due diligence. I have been a Comcast customer by default ever since they swallowed the portion of Adelphia that held my area. I say this because only recently, have I actually had a choice in the matter. So, without further ado, here is my latest Tales from Comcast Customer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently moved, I decided that even though I have a choice, incurring additional “setup” fees for switching services was not something I wanted. So they guy was there 5 days after I moved in, ran the line, and we were hot with both digital cable, and speedy internet service. I came home from work, ran some speed tests and was delighted to see that I had just almost tripled my speeds from my previous residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks go by, and this line that the Comcast installer ran from the box to my house is still strung across my lawn. I call and they say they will send someone out to put it down as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 months later, I call again; they cannot see in their system that a request to put a line in the ground was ever submitted. After 20 minutes of trying to ensure that the “Customer Service Representative” fully understood that there was actually, physically, an orange coaxial line, above ground, strung across my front lawn, that was Comcast’s responsibility, she submitted a new request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 week after the new request, I come home to a Comcast truck in the driveway. YIPEE!, nope, he was there to fill out the request for a contractor to come and put the line in the ground. So basically he had no purpose in life or in my driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 weeks after the new request, no contractor, but someone at some point came by my house and spray painted lines on my lawn where my line should be in the ground. (And no, I didn’t miss a call or the contractor coming)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 weeks after the new request, the wife is fed up and she has me call Comcast after our TV goes out for no apparent reason. Guess what I got when I called? A busy signal. That just doesn’t compute in my head. How is Comcast going to present me with a busy signal for a 24 hour service line? Anyways, the next day I call and actually get through. Now guess what they told me? Nope, they had the request, but it was for September!? The “Customer Service Representative” was nice enough to move it up to this Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Be Continued&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this event has run its course, it will be filed under “Stupid People” in the links menu, under “Tales of a Comcast Customer: EP1”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have to apologize to the whole Security community for my idiocy. Yesterday I was made aware of a post about Backtrack 3 Final coming out. The link I received was a link to Mut’s blog. While reading the post it mentioned something about an early IRC release. Proceeding to IRC I found a direct link to the ISO in the topic. Excited about the release I failed to read the rest of the topic in IRC mentioning that they wanted it to stay within the IRC community. I then started sending out a link to Mut’s post, and the link to the ISO out to my friends and the Wifi Sec mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today at some point the ISO was pulled offline, according to an email I received, due to my Wifi Sec posting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry to everyone in the Remote Exploit community, and especially Mutts, Max, and MjM. So, if you read this and see me at one of the conferences. Mention this post’s title and I owe you a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been hearing a lot of innovators posting to their blogs that they are pursuing new employment with Microsoft, and I wonder if they are making sneaky power plays into the Open Source market. Taking it’s best projects and plucking their leads. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KnoppMyth Creator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mysettopbox.tv/index.html#News&#34;&gt;http://mysettopbox.tv/index.html#News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: The above article seems to be an April Fools joke that I was late to the party on. Thanks to Mark for calling me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Cops - Owner/Operator - Paul Laudanski&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castlecops.com/t223152-Must_Read_Important_Announcement.html&#34;&gt;http://www.castlecops.com/t223152-Must_Read_Important_Announcement.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong, everyone needs their family and Open Source is a thankless job sometimes. I am not trying to dog on them for going Microsoft. I am just wondering if they are doing this to give these gents a job and make their product better, or just get rid of supporting competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just my rant on what I am seeing. Sounds a bit like dvorak.org/blog eh?&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>/post/2008/200866creators-of-new-html/</link>

      <guid>/post/2008/200866creators-of-new-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What happens when the lights go out. Power is gone and all you have left is your thoughts and a laptop that’s battery is quickly dieing? You write. Movies will take up too much power and it’s too dark to read so you write. What do you write about, does it really matter? You write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a part of a great many projects but I can’t say that I have contributed to them very much. But I would like to in this post, since I have the time all of a sudden, take the time to acknowledge the real people who are making things happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of we have Roelof Temmingh. His hard work and dedication to his project Maltego has created something as revolutionary as the search engine. Now, you may say that that is one hell of a statement and shouldn’t be tossed around like an Emmy. I am here to assure you I am not. Just as ArcSight, if implemented correctly and cared for is one of the greatest tools a Information System Incident Responder can have, Maltego is the information gatherer’s most valuable asset. From Intel bubbas to Social Engineers to Private Investigators. This tool is not something you can live without any longer. Why? Because your opponent is already using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paterva.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.paterva.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next project I would like to talk about is the WiFi Security mailing list. Dninja and Joshua Wright as some of the brightest minds in the field of 802.11. Joshua Wright is well recognized, but I think Dninja is less so. Both Josh and Dninja are working on incorporating Karma into embedded devices, mainly the Fon Router. The Fon is a extremely small form factor router that still has enough embedded memory to be useful for modding. Their continued research, by all of those in the WiFi Security mailing list, directly impact the 802.11 field. That impact is seen in the increased security we are seeing in WiFi devices and software every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/137/description&#34;&gt;http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/137/description&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mal-Aware team. Lance James and the gents over at Castle Cops are the main players in this team but collaboration from around the world is done on these mailing lists. Closely working with the FBI and other federal and foreign agencies. The brain power that make up the list of email addresses joined together in this list could swell any room. Like mythological super heroes, they dedicate their free time to making the internet a safer place each and every day. [&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mal-aware.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.mal-aware.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mal-aware.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.mal-aware.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least is the crew over at Hak.5. Darren, Wess, Ally, Paul, and the latest addition Matt. I probably wouldn’t be as ingrained in the “Hacker” world as I am now without these guys. The videos they produce on such a limited budget are entertaining and, in my opinion, rival the professionalism of Hollywood. What they produce is always innovative and informative. Even if they mod the Guitar Hero guitar every other episode. Even though they criticism from all angles, they continue to produce and put out a video podcast that is as of yet unmatched in it’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5.org&#34;&gt;http://www.hak5.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I am writing this post, other than boredom, is to sort of tip my hat in humility to these innovators. Some of the readers of my blog think highly of me. I wish only to transfer that respect to those who deserve it. I am humbled to be apart of such amazing projects and be witness to their impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Rob Fuller (a.k.a. Mubix)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. So basically, buy Maltego (or get your company/school to), join the WiFi Sec and Mal-Aware mailing lists, and watch Hak.5. Support these projects in any way you can, because they have already supported you in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oregon’s State Legislature passed a law that provides a full-tuition waiver for a bachelor’s or master’s degree at an Oregon University System institution for children or spouses of service members who died on active duty, became 100 percent disabled in connection with military service, or died as a result of a disability sustained on active duty&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facebook chat - All that and a bag of cheesy poofs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. I have to admit, they did the Facebook chat right. I like how it looks and how it works. I would only change one this and allow chats to disembark from the status bar, but other than that, congrats. It is actually keeping me on Facebook longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/438411/4879756/uploads/logo_facebook-rgb-7inch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough brown nosing, here are the pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO&lt;/strong&gt;: very well done layout - clean, crisp and not in the way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CON&lt;/strong&gt;: I have no idea when one of my friends sign on or off, it would be nice to have to show something simple as - Bob signed on, and have it as an option to turn off for those who have reached their 5000 friend limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO&lt;/strong&gt;: I now have access to all of those old friends and people that I have lost touch with over the years and didn’t know their email or IM address. This was already the case, but IMs are much more inviting to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CON&lt;/strong&gt;: Like I said above, it would be nice if I could dock and undock the IM windows. being stuck to the bottom kinda gets annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think that Facebook is littered with a lot of useless apps and spam, but the IM ability is helping to ween me back into trying and cleaning up my profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:Alright, either the Facebook code really fast, or I just didn’t know where to click, but I have been corrected. You can undock the IM interfcae by clicking on the shiloutte and clicking “Pop Out Chat”. This will create a new window and put all of your chatting in the new window. After you are done being pop’ed out, just click Pop-In on the upper right and you are back to normal. While this isn’t the 100% solution I was looking for (Ajax floating chat boxes that could be together or seperate or tabbed)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I said that I was going to start putting more security related articles up. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s now on the wire. I have applied to join the &lt;a href=&#34;http://networks.feedburner.com/Security-Bloggers-Network&#34;&gt;Security Blogger&amp;rsquo;s Network&lt;/a&gt;. So a lot more people than just the Hak.5 crew are going to possibly be reading this blog. I may or may not be chosen to join the network, but if I do, it should be an wild ride. I encourage all of you out there floating in the cloud to add the feed to your readers and to those security bloggers out there, apply to join.  The rush begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not often, especially this day in age, that shakes one to the core. This is one of those times.  Original Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightcitiesmap.com/transcript_bc.htm&#34;&gt;http://www.eightcitiesmap.com/transcript_bc.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;dr-bill-cosby-speaks&#34;&gt;DR BILL COSBY SPEAKS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;at the 50th Anniversary commemoration of the Brown vs Topeka Board of Education Supreme Court Decision&lt;/em&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, I really have to ask you to seriously consider what you&amp;rsquo;ve heard, and now this is the end of the evening so to speak. I heard a prize fight manager say to his fellow who was losing badly, &amp;ldquo;David, listen to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not what&amp;rsquo;s he&amp;rsquo;s doing to you. It&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re not doing. (laughter).  Ladies and gentlemen, these people set, they opened the doors, they gave us the right, and today, ladies and gentlemen, in our cities and public schools we have fifty percent drop out. In our own neighborhood, we have men in prison. No longer is a person embarrassed because they&amp;rsquo;re pregnant without a husband. (clapping) No longer is a boy considered an embarrassment if he tries to run away from being the father of the unmarried child (clapping)  Ladies and gentlemen, the lower economic and lower middle economic people are [not*] holding their end in this deal. In the neighborhood that most of us grew up in, parenting is not going on. (clapping) In the old days, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t hooky school because every drawn shade was an eye (laughing). And before your mother got off the bus and to the house, she knew exactly where you had gone, who had gone into the house, and where you got on whatever you had one and where you got it from. Parents don&amp;rsquo;t know that today.  I&amp;rsquo;m talking about these people who cry when their son is standing there in an orange suit. Where were you when he was two? (clapping) Where were you when he was twelve? (clapping) Where were you when he was eighteen, and how come you don&amp;rsquo;t know he had a pistol? (clapping) And where is his father, and why don&amp;rsquo;t you know where he is? And why doesn&amp;rsquo;t the father show up to talk to this boy?  The church is only open on Sunday. And you can&amp;rsquo;t keep asking Jesus to ask doing things for you (clapping). You can&amp;rsquo;t keep asking that God will find a way. God is tired of you (clapping and laughing). God was there when they won all those cases. 50 in a row. That&amp;rsquo;s where God was because these people were doing something. And God said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to find a way.&amp;rdquo; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there when God said it… I&amp;rsquo;m making this up (laughter). But it sounds like what God would do (laughter).  We cannot blame white people. White people (clapping) .. white people don&amp;rsquo;t live over there. They close up the shop early. The Korean ones still don&amp;rsquo;t know us as well…they stay open 24 hours (laughter).  I&amp;rsquo;m looking and I see a man named Kenneth Clark. He and his wife Mamie…Kenneth&amp;rsquo;s still alive. I have to apologize to him for these people because Kenneth said it straight. He said you have to strengthen yourselves…and we&amp;rsquo;ve got to have that black doll. And everybody said it. Julian Bond said it. Dick Gregory said it. All these lawyers said it. And you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know that anybody had done a damned thing.  50 percent drop out rate, I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, and people in jail, and women having children by five, six different men. Under what excuse, I want somebody to love me, and as soon as you have it, you forget to parent. Grandmother, mother, and great grandmother in the same room, raising children, and the child knows nothing about love or respect of any one of the three of them (clapping). All this child knows is &amp;ldquo;gimme, gimme, gimme.&amp;rdquo; These people want to buy the friendship of a child….and the child couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less. Those of us sitting out here who have gone on to some college or whatever we&amp;rsquo;ve done, we still fear our parents (clapping and laughter). And these people are not parenting. They&amp;rsquo;re buying things for the kid. $500 sneakers, for what? They won&amp;rsquo;t buy or spend $250 on Hooked on Phonics. (clapping)  AKenneth Clark, somewhere in his home in upstate New York…just looking ahead. Thank God, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on, thank God. But these people, the ones up here in the balcony fought so hard. Looking at the incarcerated, these are not political criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake! Then we all run out and are outraged, &amp;ldquo;The cops shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have shot him&amp;rdquo; What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand? (laughter and clapping). I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else (laughter) And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said if get caught with it you&amp;rsquo;re going to embarrass your mother. Not you&amp;rsquo;re going to get your butt kicked. No. You&amp;rsquo;re going to embarrass your mother. You&amp;rsquo;re going to embarrass your family.  If knock that girl up, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to run away because it&amp;rsquo;s going to be too embarrassing for your family. In the old days, a girl getting pregnant had to go down South, and then her mother would go down to get her. But the mother had the baby. I said the mother had the baby. The girl didn&amp;rsquo;t have a baby. The mother had the baby in two weeks. (laughter) We are not parenting. Ladies and gentlemen, listen to these people, they are showing you what&amp;rsquo;s wrong. People putting their clothes on backwards. -isn&amp;rsquo;t that a sign of something going on wrong? (laughter)  Are you not paying attention, people with their hat on backwards, pants down around the crack. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that a sign of something, or are you waiting for Jesus to pull his pants up (laughter and clapping ). Isn&amp;rsquo;t it a sign of something when she&amp;rsquo;s got her dress all the way up to the crack…and got all kinds of needles and things going through her body. What part of Africa did this come from? (laughter). We are not Africans. Those people are not Africans, they don&amp;rsquo;t know a damned thing about Africa. With names like Shaniqua, Shaligua, Mohammed and all that crap and all of them are in jail. (When we give these kinds names to our children, we give them the strength and inspiration in the meaning of those names. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of giving them strong names if there is not parenting and values backing it up).  Brown Versus the Board of Education is no longer the white person&amp;rsquo;s problem. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to take the neighborhood back (clapping). We&amp;rsquo;ve got to go in there. Just forget telling your child to go to the Peace Corps. It&amp;rsquo;s right around the corner. (laughter) It&amp;rsquo;s standing on the corner. It can&amp;rsquo;t speak English. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to speak English. I can&amp;rsquo;t even talk the way these people talk. &amp;ldquo;Why you ain&amp;rsquo;t where you is go, ra,&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t know who these people are. And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk (laughter). Then I heard the father talk. This is all in the house. You used to talk a certain way on the corner and you got into the house and switched to English. Everybody knows it&amp;rsquo;s important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can&amp;rsquo;t land a plane with &amp;ldquo;why you ain&amp;rsquo;t…&amp;rdquo; You can&amp;rsquo;t be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth. There is no Bible that has that kind of language. Where did these people get the idea that they&amp;rsquo;re moving ahead on this. Well, they know they&amp;rsquo;re not, they&amp;rsquo;re just hanging out in the same place, five or six generations sitting in the projects when you&amp;rsquo;re just supposed to stay there long enough to get a job and move out.  Now look, I&amp;rsquo;m telling you. It&amp;rsquo;s not what they&amp;rsquo;re doing to us. It&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re not doing. 50 percent drop out. Look, we&amp;rsquo;re raising our own ingrown immigrants. These people are fighting hard to be ignorant. There&amp;rsquo;s no English being spoken, and they&amp;rsquo;re walking and they&amp;rsquo;re angry. Oh God, they&amp;rsquo;re angry and they have pistols and they shoot and they do stupid things. And after they kill somebody, they don&amp;rsquo;t have a plan. Just murder somebody. Boom. Over what? A pizza? And then run to the poor cousin&amp;rsquo;s house. They sit there and the cousin says &amp;ldquo;what are you doing here?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I just killed somebody, man.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I just killed somebody, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to stay here.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;No, you don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Well, give me some money, I&amp;rsquo;ll go…&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Where are you going?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;North Carolina.&amp;rdquo; Everybody wanted to go to North Carolina. But the police know where you&amp;rsquo;re going because your cousin has a record.  Five or six different children, same woman, eight, ten different husbands or whatever, pretty soon you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to have DNA cards so you can tell who you&amp;rsquo;re making love to. You don&amp;rsquo;t who this is. It might be your grandmother. (laughter) I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, they&amp;rsquo;re young enough. Hey, you have a baby when you&amp;rsquo;re twelve. Your baby turns thirteen and has a baby, how old are you? Huh? Grandmother. By the time you&amp;rsquo;re twelve, you could have sex with your grandmother, you keep those numbers coming. I&amp;rsquo;m just predicting.  I&amp;rsquo;m saying Brown Vs. Board of Education. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to hit the streets, ladies and gentlemen. I&amp;rsquo;m winding up, now , no more applause. I&amp;rsquo;m saying, look at the Black Muslims. There are Black Muslims standing on the street corners and they say so forth and so on, and we&amp;rsquo;rere laughing at them because they have bean pies and all that, but you don&amp;rsquo;t read &amp;ldquo;Black Muslim gunned down while chastising drug dealer.&amp;rdquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t read that. They don&amp;rsquo;t shoot down Black Muslims. You understand me. Muslims tell you to get out of the neighborhood. When you want to clear your neighborhood out, first thing you do is go get the Black Muslims, bean pies and all (laughter). And your neighborhood is then clear. The police can&amp;rsquo;t do it .  I&amp;rsquo;m telling you Christians, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with you? Why can&amp;rsquo;t you hit the streets? Why can&amp;rsquo;t you clean it out yourselves? It&amp;rsquo;s our time now, ladies and gentlemen. It is our time (clapping). And I&amp;rsquo;ve got good news for you. It&amp;rsquo;s not about money. It&amp;rsquo;s about you doing something ordinarily that we do&amp;ndash;get in somebody else&amp;rsquo;s business. It&amp;rsquo;s time for you to not accept the language that these people are speaking, which will take them nowhere. What the hell good is Brown V. Board of Education if nobody wants it?  What is it with young girls getting after some girl who wants to still remain a virgin. Who are these sick black people and where did they come from and why haven&amp;rsquo;t they been parented to shut up? To go up to girls and try to get a club where &amp;ldquo;you are nobody..,&amp;rdquo; this is a sickness ladies and gentlemen and we are not paying attention to these children. These are children. They don&amp;rsquo;t know anything. They don&amp;rsquo;t have anything. They&amp;rsquo;re homeless people. All they know how to do is beg. And you give it to them, trying to win their friendship. And what are they good for? And then they stand there in an orange suit and you drop to your knees, &amp;ldquo;(crying sound) He didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, he didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything.&amp;rdquo; Yes, he did do it. And you need to have an orange suit on too (laughter, clapping).  So, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for the award (big laughter) and giving me an opportunity to speak because, I mean, this is the future, and all of these people who lined up and done..they&amp;rsquo;ve got to be wondering what the hell happened. Brown V. Board of Education, these people who marched and were hit in the face with rocks and punched in the face to get an education and we got these knuckleheads walking around who don&amp;rsquo;t want to learn English (clapping) I know that you all know it. I just want to get you as angry that you ought to be. When you walk around the neighborhood and you see this stuff, that stuff&amp;rsquo;s not funny. These people are not funny anymore. And that &amp;rsquo;s not brother. And that&amp;rsquo;s not my sister. They&amp;rsquo;re faking and they&amp;rsquo;re dragging me way down because the state, the city and all these people have to pick up the tab on them because they don&amp;rsquo;t want to accept that they have to study to get an education.  We have to begin to build in the neighborhood, have restaurants, have cleaners, have pharmacies, have real estate, have medical buildings instead of trying to rob them all. And so, ladies and gentlemen, please, Dorothy Height, where ever she&amp;rsquo;s sitting, she didn&amp;rsquo;t do all that stuff so that she could hear somebody say &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t stand algebra, I can&amp;rsquo;t stand…and &amp;ldquo;what you is.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s horrible.  Basketball players, multimillionaires can&amp;rsquo;t write a paragraph. Football players, multimillionaires, can&amp;rsquo;t read. Yes. Multimillionaires. Well, Brown V Board of Education, where are we today? It&amp;rsquo;s there. They paved the way. What did we do with it. The white man, he&amp;rsquo;s laughing, got to be laughing. 50 percent drop out, rest of them in prison.  You got to tell me that if there was parenting, help me, if there was parenting, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have picked up the Coca Cola bottle and walked out with it to get shot in the back of the head. He wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. Not if he loved his parents. And not if they were parenting! Not if the father would come home. Not if the boy hadn&amp;rsquo;t dropped the sperm cell inside of the girl and the girl had said, &amp;ldquo;No, you have to come back here and be the father of this child.&amp;rdquo; Not ..&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&amp;rdquo;  Therefore, you have the pile up of these sweet beautiful things born by nature raised by no one. Give them presents. You&amp;rsquo;re raising pimps. That&amp;rsquo;s what a pimp is. A pimp will act nasty to you so you have to go out and get them something. And then you bring it back and maybe he or she hugs you. And that&amp;rsquo;s why pimp is so famous. They&amp;rsquo;ve got a drink called the &amp;ldquo;Pimp-something.&amp;rdquo; You all wonder what that&amp;rsquo;s about, don&amp;rsquo;t you? Well, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to let Jesus figure it out for you (laughter). Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve got something to tell you about Jesus. When you go to the church, look at the stained glass things of Jesus. Look at them. Is Jesus smiling? Not in one picture. So, tell your friends. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to do something. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to make Jesus smile. Let&amp;rsquo;s start parenting. Thank you, thank you (clapping, cheers)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;George Carlin is funny. Offensive to most everyone, but I think the whole &amp;ldquo;I hate everyone, so it&amp;rsquo;s not an &amp;lsquo;ism&amp;rsquo; thing&amp;rdquo; works here. Here he is on the topic of Religion:   [youtube &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeSSwKffj9o&#34;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeSSwKffj9o&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;QUESTIONS ********* Why do you need a driver&amp;rsquo;s license to buy liquor in America when you can&amp;rsquo;t drink and drive?  Why isn&amp;rsquo;t phonetic spelled the way it sounds?  Why are there interstate highways in Hawaii?  Why are there flotation devices under plane seats instead of parachutes?  Why are cigarettes sold in gas stations when smoking is prohibited there?  Do you need a silencer if you are going to shoot a mime?  Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations?  How does the guy who drives the snowplow get to work in the mornings?  If 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the doors?  If a cow laughed, would milk come out her nose?  If nothing ever sticks to TEFLON, how do they make TEFLON to stick to the pan?  If you tied buttered toast to the back of a cat and dropped it from a height, what would happen?  If you&amp;rsquo;re in a vehicle going the speed of light, what happens when you turn on the headlights?  You know how most packages say &amp;ldquo;Open here&amp;rdquo;. What is the protocol if the package says, &amp;ldquo;Open somewhere else&amp;rdquo;?  Why do they put Braille dots on the keypad of the drive-up ATM?  Why do Americans drive on parkways and park on driveways?  Why is it that when you transport something by car, it&amp;rsquo;s called a shipment, but when you transport something by ship, it&amp;rsquo;s called cargo?  You know that little indestructible black box that is used on planes, why can&amp;rsquo;t they make the whole plane out of the same substance?  Why is it that when you&amp;rsquo;re driving and looking for an address, you turn down the volume on the radio?  Why does your nose run and your feet smell?  Why do American always call for the cheque, and then give one back to the waitress?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multicast and some random thoughts</title>
      <link>/post/2007/200761multicast-and-some-random-thoughts-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2007 12:56:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2007/200761multicast-and-some-random-thoughts-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I am a complete noob when it comes to multicast and recently I have been hearing about it more and more. I know it&amp;rsquo;s been out there since the dawn of time but I simply thought it was a way of broadcasting video across the network. WRONG. So for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, and correct me if I am wrong, a computer or device sends out a multicast packet headed for a 244.X.X.X and just like a broadcast packet (255.255.255.255) it gets heard by everyone. Also like a broadcast packet, it falls within the broadcast boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why bring this up? Because I was thinking that a Multicast scanner would be a great tool for pentesters to use inside of a network to get a more complete picture of internal services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as per the torrent. I have started assembling and organizing it. This way each item will be in an archive that you can choose to download or not from the torrent. Family is still in town so bare with me just a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NAC in use</title>
      <link>/post/2007/2007418nac-in-use-html/</link>

      <guid>/post/2007/2007418nac-in-use-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://pauldotcom.com/wiki/index.php/Episode66#Open-source_NAC_with_Packet_Fence&#34;&gt;Episode 66&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pauldotcom.com/&#34;&gt;PaulDotCom Security Weekly&lt;/a&gt; and they briefly touched on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packetfence.org&#34;&gt;Packetfence&lt;/a&gt;. Packet Fence is a Open Source &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Access_Control&#34;&gt;NAC&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time that I have really gotten hand on a NAC. I have heard of NAC and at ShmooCon Labs, I was part of Simple Nomad&amp;rsquo;s team and Vernier&amp;rsquo;s IPS/NAC. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to get hands on during the con. So that puts me in the &amp;ldquo;noob&amp;rdquo; category. So, when I explained NAC to the team at work, they asked a question I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer with any technical expertise. So I will pose the question to you the reader: &lt;strong&gt;What do you use NAC systems for?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/comment.php?serendipity[entry_id]=98&amp;amp;serendipity[type]=comments&#34;&gt;Comment here.&lt;/a&gt; or email me.  Also, the Hack or Halo image has been fixed and is up: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.vulnerableminds.com/2007/04/shmoocon-07-hack-or-halo-virtual.html&#34;&gt;http://blog.vulnerableminds.com/2007/04/shmoocon-07-hack-or-halo-virtual.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On a RANT</title>
      <link>/post/2007/2007221on-a-rant-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2007 15:34:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2007/2007221on-a-rant-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, every blog entry on every blog, is in fact a RANT. So, stating that one is, is kind of pointless. That being said. Here is my rant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have changed this part of my blogisphere, I have been getting guff about not covering certain exploits and 0-days. So here it is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/3193&#34;  title=&#34;Excel 0-day&#34;&gt;Microsoft Excel 0-day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The easiest way to make a unix based system (Mac) insecure:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Step 1: Install a Microsoft Product&lt;br /&gt;
as for the Windows Versions; &lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;rsquo;T OPEN ATTACHMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-While I am on the topic. Word users, watch out as well. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/3260&#34;  title=&#34;milw0rm exploit #3260&#34;&gt;milw0rm exploit #3260&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I troll all the security sites with my RSS reader, and as soon as I find something that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been covered to death (i.e. ANOTHER Excel/Word exploit) I&amp;rsquo;ll post it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting off my soap box. For those that have found my previous &amp;lsquo;rants&amp;rsquo; informative and did not send me an email wining that I didn&amp;rsquo;t cove the aforementioned exploit. I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, that’s just my take on things, I’m just another security guy in a room with a small sign on the door that says “IT Dept”. What would I know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now that I am sorta in the eZine world with the release of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5.org/wiki/Analog5:eZine&#34;  title=&#34;Analog.5&#34;&gt;Analog.5&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5.org&#34;  title=&#34;Hak.5&#34;&gt;Hak.5&lt;/a&gt;.  I wanted to tag another eZine well worth reading. &lt;a href=&#34;http://neworder.box.sk/user.php?name=rattle&#34;  title=&#34;Rattle&#39;s Neworder Profile&#34;&gt;Rattle&lt;/a&gt; and the folks from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awarenetwork.org/&#34;  title=&#34;Aware Networks&#34;&gt;.aware&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awarenetwork.org/etc/zine1/&#34;  title=&#34;.aware&#39;s eZine&#34;&gt;.aware eZine&lt;/a&gt; or lovingly called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awarenetwork.org/etc/zine1/&#34;  title=&#34;.aware&#39;s eZine&#34;&gt;.behold&lt;/a&gt; check it out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Boss! I can&#39;t come in today. I woke up this morning and found 20 inches of snow in front of my drive way.   
  
Don&#39;t we all wish it was this simple. Anyways, I went home for Christmas, back to Oregon. Had a good time, got some good presents, yup... everything was good.  
  
New Years is coming up. 2007...  yeah, the whole millennium thing is wearing off.  
  
As for the key chain, I got a cool skeleton key chain for Christmas that is almost impossible to fit in my pocket, but oh so worth it.  
&lt;div class=&#39;s9y_typeset s9y_typeset_center&#39; style=&#39;text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 0px auto&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://room362.com/uploads/keychain.serendipityThumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  
  

&lt;p&gt;To put a little bit of tech into this boring excuse for a post, I just learned of something called the Microsoft Action Pack. This is a 300 dollar investment that gets you dozens of copies of all of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s products, legit, from Microsoft. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.petri.co.il/ms_action_pack_subscription.htm&#34;  title=&#34;Microsoft Action Pack - What it is and why you need it.&#34;&gt;this link for more information&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://digg.com/tech_deals/Microsoft_Action_Pack_Subscription_%E2%80%93_What_it_is_and_Why_you_Need_it_&#34;  title=&#34;Digg their article!&#34;&gt;digg it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I am home. Not actually, I&amp;rsquo;m in the U.s. waiting for my flight to NOVA. I have a very interesting flight, more so than usual. First things first: No, the person next to me wasn&amp;rsquo;t an old lady that wanted to talk my ear off or a crying baby. It was actually a mother of an adorable boy that was sitting near the window. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear about good stuff. That isn&amp;rsquo;t interesting, you want to hear about the oddities, the bad stuff, and Inquirer type news. Well Inquirer, eat your heart out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nazi Stewerdess: Before take off, this woman came out of no where, romped up the isle stopped at a very specific point, looked at the person sitting in seat &amp;lsquo;22 B&amp;rsquo; and said &amp;ldquo;FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT&amp;rdquo;. Then proceeded to romp off. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t know if planes have the technology yet to do this or this woman just had little tiny video cameras installed in every seat, but she was scary. The thing that made this woman even more weird was the fact that she did this to a couple other times, yet, after take off, she was no where to be seen. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t serving food, she wasn&amp;rsquo;t colleting trash. My row mate and myself swore that she was now sitting in first class and all the other flight attendants were secretly saying &amp;lsquo;Zig Hail&amp;rsquo; or however that phrase is spelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beast: I saw this one a mile away. She was in the chair in front of mine, with here neck pillow, buckled in, persperating, while people were still boarding. She had two seats open next to her and she was trying to go to sleep. Then, when someone finally came to sit down, she shuffled them in and &amp;lsquo;helped&amp;rsquo; slam their bags into the overhead bins. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, she never put her seat upright, so when it came time to let my row mates in, they got the pleasure of squeezing by her lowered seat in an already cramped area. But the best part is yet to come. I opened up my laptop to watch episode 11 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.purepwnage.com/&#34;&gt;purepwnage&lt;/a&gt; and catch up on a little &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grc.com/sn&#34;&gt;Security Now&lt;/a&gt;, when she some how manages to put her seat even farther back. So here is me, at 6&amp;rsquo;4&amp;rdquo; crammed into an Economy seat for 13 hours with no room as it is, and The Beast decides to recline her seat more. Yay. I was so afraid that she would manage the feat of putting her seat back farther and break my laptop&amp;rsquo;s monitor that I turned it off and put it away. Now, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I am usually a very nice person, and I initially felt pity for her because she looked quite scared to be on a plane, but it turned out to be annoyance, not fright. And, the name that I have given her does not denote weight, she is just mildly overweight. It is the combination of the ugly, the rudeness, the mild obecity, and the miraculous way she can bend a airline seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the long post. I just have nothing else better to do then wait for my next flight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m taking a time out of all the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, Japan to write a little and promise picutres in the near future. Well, once my integrated card reader decides to read xD M-class cards. I just applied the patch from HP but it still has major problems. It gets to the first image and stops reading and I get all kinds of write errors. To add salt to the wound, I forgot my USB cable to my camera, so I really have no way of getting my pictures off the camera. And the hits keep rolling in, I just finished a day in Akihabara, better known as the Electric Town. Whis is the biggest Computer/Electronic shopping &amp;lsquo;area&amp;rsquo; in the world, and not a single store had the type of USB cable I needed. So, you&amp;rsquo;ll get pictures as soon as I can get this crap reader to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I had a blast with my wife and son in Akihabara, they didn&amp;rsquo;t, but I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Happy New Year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know it&amp;rsquo;s been a while AGAIN since I have posted, but I just wanted to say Happy New Years to everyone. This year is going to be a very different one for me since my wife and I are expecting in Feb. I am really excited about my future son. It is a blessing to be able to bring a life into the world, and a big responsibility. I am also starting college back up. I will be going for a BS in Information Assurance.  Another thing that I want to point out is that I shovled out some dough and am getting 2 x 1 GB (Cas 2) 184pin DDR ram sticks. I am note sure what Cas 2 is, but I am told it&amp;rsquo;s the best out right now. In other news, I went down to the party with the Hak.5 crew again and had a blast. I am starting to become a regular down there, which is fine by me. It is pretty refreshing to be able to have fun, party, and then sit down for a late night hack session all with the same people. In Bigger new (however not as big as my future son) I am now doing a podcast called Sploitcast with Harrison Holland and Jonny G&amp;rsquo; from Hak.5. Our first episode airs Jan 8 and I am extremely excited to see how it all turns out. Well. it is getting really late and it is way my bed time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reinvention of 007 &#43; Back to the future = Really dumb idea</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; Some nice digg user decided to comment and inform me that this was the FIRST Bond book. Basically Bond before the toys. hmm, nope, still don’t like the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Ok. I’m pissed. **&lt;br /&gt;
Let me get this straight. You’ve got&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A legendary name (“James Bond”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi-million dollar market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slew of Hollywood stars that have made 007 great&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fan clubs spanning the globe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MILLIONS OF DEDICATED 007 FANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 Video games&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; full length feature films&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you want to REINVENT the CHARACTER?!? Are you nuts? You want to make him YOUNG?! You want to make the new movie based on a FARCE that was done in 1967 WITH THE SAME NAME! AND YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY “Q” AND THE TOYS! Come on. You are taking away EVERYTHING that is BOND. Ok now that I am done ranting and raving at the lunatics that are making this &lt;strong&gt;STUPID IDEA&lt;/strong&gt; a reality, here is a little background: I got home today and checked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engadget.com/&#34;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; like always and I see this: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000993059446/&#34;&gt;Bond to fly solo without Q in Casino Royale?&lt;/a&gt; which led me to this blog: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.therawfeed.com/2005/09/no-gadgets-for-new-james-bond.html&#34;&gt;No Gadgets For New James Bond &lt;/a&gt;. I did some more research and found out that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JL0I/ref=pd_sim_dv_1/102-8044842-7243368?v=glance&amp;amp;s=dvd&#34;&gt;Casino Royale is already a DVD on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It was a 1967 &lt;strong&gt;FARCE&lt;/strong&gt; to make fun of 007:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editorial Reviews of “Casino Royale” 1967&lt;br /&gt;
Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;
John Huston was only one of five directors on this expensive, all-star 1967 spoof of Ian Fleming’s 007 lore. David Niven is the aging Sir James Bond, called out of retirement to take on the organized threat of SMERSH and pass on the secret-agent mantle to his idiot son (&lt;strong&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/strong&gt;). An amazing cast (Orson Welles, Peter Sellers, Deborah Kerr, etc.) is wonderful to look at, but the film is not as funny as it should be, and the romping starts to look mannered after awhile. The musical score by Burt Bacharach, however, is a keeper. &amp;ndash;Tom Keogh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you want to watch the &lt;strong&gt;REAL BOND&lt;/strong&gt;. Check out this list on Amazon for all the &lt;strong&gt;REAL Bond movies&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/1Y177VPLGGWDX/qid=1127166697/sr=5-2/ref=sr_5_2/102-8044842-7243368&#34;&gt;Listmania! All the Bond Movies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Here is the official news from BBC: &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4256024.stm&#34;&gt; James Bond writer ‘reinvents’ spy&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all the Bonds of old. We salute you. (And hope you don’t have to suffer through watching this movie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jd&lt;/p&gt;
