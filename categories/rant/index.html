            	I&rsquo;ve taken a rather long hiatus from blogging. This is mostly because I was fed up with the blogging platform that I had (Squarespace) and didn&rsquo;t really have any alternatives that met all of the features I wanted.
So, where am I at now? Github actually. Github allows users to create &ldquo;Github Pages&rdquo; for repositories (or be it&rsquo;s own repo). For the most part these pages are written in Markdown. It&rsquo;s late and I don&rsquo;t feel like looking up who, but someone created a project called &ldquo;Jekyll&rdquo; which is a Ruby based static page generator and then another project called &ldquo;Octopress&rdquo; popped up using Jekyll to create a static html based blogging platform.

            	Problems are that everyone does this whole blogging thing in so many different ways. Me, personally? I like to have a client that I can save drafts it, work on things a little bit here and there and then finalize stuff when I&rsquo;m ready to post. I have a couple dozen of these posts ready and set with final tweaks needed but my blogging software Squarespace up and moved on to &ldquo;Squarespace 6&rdquo;.

            	I&rsquo;ve been cracking passwords for a while and use a myriad of tools in a certain order to get the job done. I find that Cain is still my Go-to for allowing me to visualize the process and do some basic sorting (really wish I could search in-app). But I&rsquo;ve been asking around on twitter some questions like Why is GPU cracking for 50k hashes faster than Rainbow Tables (most say the bottleneck is the HDD read style and speed) and many asked what all of my compalints are so I figured this would be the best place (vice multiple emails)

            	This day and age everyone is worried about the insider threat. Internal Penetration Testing doesn&rsquo;t really test what would happen if your janitor got paid 50 bucks to put a USB stick in one of your servers. External Penetration Tests are never scoped for that sort of testing. So what is a company to do? How can they know what the risk is? The answer? Usually they guess or assume. Mostly because they are scared to find out, it&rsquo;s happened to them before, or one of a million different justifications.

If you have jailbroken your iPad you might want to check out a little file called &ldquo;master.passwd&rdquo;. In it, there is another user called &lsquo;mobile&rsquo; which has been pointed out since 2008 (here) on the iPhone as another account to change the password of.

            	This is far from a new idea, however it&rsquo;s not something that is easily provable. So I had an idea this morning. I posed the following question on Twitter:
You know what I got in return? a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo; from everyone. (well I had one outlier but, who doesn&rsquo;t when you are trying to apply science to prove art) I challenge you to name another non-artistic career that people are so passionate about that they would stay in it even if they won the lottery.

            	If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, LinkedIn has started allowing you to link your Twitter account to your LinkedIn account. So, I didn&rsquo;t know this (since I opted out), but apparently LinkedIn will kick your status updates to Twitter&hellip; like when you get a new job&hellip;
Privacy settings out the window! Woohoo for Web 2.0!

            	We (the security community) all know, and make fun of &ldquo;Users&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Admins&rdquo;. They are derogatory terms in our community. So much so, that they could almost be classified at curse words. (I can see the XKCD now: Security stick figure talking to IT stick figure. &ldquo;You stupid A****&ldquo;).
While I neither discount their &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; to making my day fun, I feel that a lot of people miss an even bigger threat: Policies and Procedures, or SOP (Standard Operating Procedures).

            	Yes, I just called everyone who works at Apple an Oompa Loompa, but I digress:
I was reading Brooke Crothers&rsquo; story on the Apple &lsquo;gag&rsquo; order [1] and couldn&rsquo;t help but think of how Apple has created an almost similar situation. Everyone wants to know what Apple is up to, can&rsquo;t stop talking about it. Buzz Out Loud [2] even had people call and email asking them to see if they could do a show without mentioning Apple or the iPhone.

When I took my hiatus from Twitter, I zero&rsquo;d out my followers, so, if you care to, please check to see if you are still following me. I will be watching my follows closely and will refollow people I might have missed in my initial run through.

Update 2 Since people can&rsquo;t seem to let it go, I would say that I was totally wrong and the nmap was absolutely never used in nessus ever, but then I would be caught in another absolute that I can&rsquo;t confirm. According to their wiki, the nmap nasl script were taken out because people were No, I haven&rsquo;t listened to the latest episode of Securabit in which Paul comes on and talks about Nessus.

I want to pose a statement. &ldquo;Simplicity is Security&rdquo;. The reason I say this is that this day in age, at least in the US, &lsquo;convenience&rsquo; is king. And we try to protect those conveniences with &lsquo;security&rsquo;. Let me start over a bit, this train of thought all started when I started to explain the insecurities in WiMAX to my wife.

            	I recently visited Tokyo, Japan. Just as always, my curiosity got the best of me and I started to calculate the population density of the buildings where I was staying. Giving fudge factor of non-populated apartments, I estimated 8,500 families in twelve 15 story buildings, living in a 1.5 mile square piece of land.That&rsquo;s CRAZY. Mass transit and unrestricted modes of transit are not a whim, they are a requirement. I bet you&rsquo;re asking how this applies to security, or for that matter computers at all.

            	When I was in middle school, I told a lie. I was so good at telling lies, and remembering even the infinite details of these lies that I could make them believable. Later in life, I learned that this skill was called “Social Engineering ;-)”, but back to the story; I told everyone that I had won a shopping spree at “Incredible Universe”, now named “Fry’s”. Even the teacher believed me.

I fit no minority profiles in other words. I tell you this so that you can latch on to it as why I don&rsquo;t understand anything in your rebuttal.

In paragraphs 2-6 he talks about two points. The first being that Hacker Conferences have become sort of commercialized with most speakers going for their day in the lime light or to pimp some product/0day. And the second being a lot of the talks are things that most can’t go home / back to work and test out or implement.

            	Last Friday (March 6th, 2009) I posed the question above. What I got in return was nothing short of amazing, and to tell you the truth, it amazed me how the tally rounded out. I categorized the answers and counted them up (MANAGERS, listen up!):
 (12 votes) - Security Fundamentals: This category involves the application of A/V, IDS/IPS, basic safe surfing techniques, least privilege use, and an understanding of phishing.

            	First I wanted to say, sorry for this and the last installment of Room362 being non-technical. They are topics that I feel strongly about and so felt impelled to share.One of the biggest problems in the world, IMHO, are people who have unfounded hate. This is compounded by the anonymity of the Internet. Allowing that hate to have no reprocussion or identity. Let me also say I have a deep respect for Free Speech, the depths of which I fear, few truly know.

            	My recent post &ldquo;OzymanDNS - Tunneling SSH over DNS&rdquo; caused a good friend, and someone I highly respect in the information security field, Dave Hull from Trusted Signal, to call me out on the ethics of the post.
Instead of lying to you, Dave, and to myself, I did not put any thought into the ethics of the post until Dave brought it up. Well, except for that auto subconscious RIGHT/WRONG check.

            	Recently I have been debating on whether to get a Netbook or the Kindle 2. (I am only in this debate because my lovely wife decided to buy a table and chairs, for the house. There is no winning when they buy things for &lsquo;the house&rsquo; or &lsquo;the kids&rsquo;).
Anyways, I tweeted up my dilemma and got a huge amount of responses. They came from both sides of the fence. Some said Kindle and some said Netbook, and they all had good arguments.

            	Most of you Twitterholics have seen this beautiful status. You get a total of 100 API calls per Twitter account per hour. What happens if you use all of your afforded calls? You can just use http://www.twitter.com/ no problem right? Well you loose a lot of what makes Twitter clients so useful (search, grouping, instant updates.. etc).
Well, what if you leave you client up at home? TweetDeck by itself uses most of the API calls just by itself.

The moment that PDANet published that they released an updated version that allows USB tethering, I ran home and “QuickPWNd” my phone (which took all 5 minutes). Loaded the app and now I had the coveted TETHERING. I was free of my bind to Comcast or Free Public Wifi.

I need a video of The Middler in action. From start (downloading) to finish (compromise / root / BeEF / owange) of another machine.
The video must be without audio, pausing a bit with each step, and a maximum of 1020 x 720 in resolution preferably in Camtasia Studio format.

            	TiVo and DVRs in general have brought TV watching a long way. Some of the innovations that have come of it have made the TV experience better. Commercial skipping is my own personal favorite. But some of the other features are pausing, rewinding, and fast forwarding (after you are behind a bit obviously) and finally recording. Now, recording live TV is nothing new. People have done it since VCRs were invented, and I’m sure much before then.

            	Today I was in a brief / talk / meeting and I just wanted to share with you some of the things that I saw in this event that might better help you know what NOT to do while getting up in front of any size crowd.
 Death by bullets (Yes this is bulleted to be ironic). But seriously, this was a reoccuring theme throughout the meeting. Try and keep it to 3 or 5.

            	Yesterday on Twitter I posed 3 questions:
Question 1: Now that Clickjacking has faded away from “Newest Greatest BAD STUFF”, how many implemented NoScript personally? What about Enterprise wide?
Question 2: Now, everyone who responded that you are still at IE in the enterprise. Why? Did you show the powers that be clickjacking and it’s effects?
Question 3: Ok here is the final question of the trio, Why, since we rely on IE, aren’t we screeming at M$ to implement NoScript-like features?

            	I have had this rant on Twitter (if they had threading I would link to it). I have also had it in person a half dozen times at CSI Annual. And a piece of it was touched on a piece of the puzzle by Jack Daniel on his blog posting “The Fallacy of Penetration Testing”. We as “Security Professionals” have a big problem. We usually don’t have the power to make change.

 Now even Leo Laporte, while being interviewed on the Geek Cred podcast said that as a broadcaster (which can be translated into “Content Producer”), your audience is the most important thing and your responsibility is to them.

            	I use gmail. Not really a big admission nor, very hard to find out. But the reason I use it is becasuse of it’s theading and archiving. For me those two abilities are unmatched anywhere else, both Outlook and Thunderbird fail horribly at this.
More to the point, I have reached a certain level of ‘zen’ with my GTD methods on gmail. I am in a constant battle for “Inbox Zero” and have “Starring” extremely useless for me.

Maltego is an awesome tool, it’s also GIVEN AWAY for FREE.. As in beer, which they allow you to use their servers to do your stupid little ego searches on.** STOP TRYING TO STEAL IT.**

It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.
My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”

            	I am truely getting tired of iPhone &ldquo;Web Apps&rdquo;. I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone. They do have a pretty interface and I have to give props to some of the design developers, but does this seem more of a copout to anyone else?
I&rsquo;ll give an example. I LOVE Remember the Milk.

            	Now, I don’t like to publicly bad mouth companies, but at some point, Comcast’s lack of “service” has got to stop. Well, let me rephrase that: Comcast needs to be held accountable for their utter lack of due diligence. I have been a Comcast customer by default ever since they swallowed the portion of Adelphia that held my area. I say this because only recently, have I actually had a choice in the matter.

            	So, I have to apologize to the whole Security community for my idiocy. Yesterday I was made aware of a post about Backtrack 3 Final coming out. The link I received was a link to Mut’s blog. While reading the post it mentioned something about an early IRC release. Proceeding to IRC I found a direct link to the ISO in the topic. Excited about the release I failed to read the rest of the topic in IRC mentioning that they wanted it to stay within the IRC community.

            	A while ago I said that I was going to start putting more security related articles up. Well, it&rsquo;s now on the wire. I have applied to join the Security Blogger&rsquo;s Network. So a lot more people than just the Hak.5 crew are going to possibly be reading this blog. I may or may not be chosen to join the network, but if I do, it should be an wild ride.

            	So I am a complete noob when it comes to multicast and recently I have been hearing about it more and more. I know it&rsquo;s been out there since the dawn of time but I simply thought it was a way of broadcasting video across the network. WRONG. So for those who don&rsquo;t know, and correct me if I am wrong, a computer or device sends out a multicast packet headed for a 244.

            	Recently I was listening to Episode 66 of PaulDotCom Security Weekly and they briefly touched on Packetfence. Packet Fence is a Open Source NAC. This is the first time that I have really gotten hand on a NAC. I have heard of NAC and at ShmooCon Labs, I was part of Simple Nomad&rsquo;s team and Vernier&rsquo;s IPS/NAC. However, I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to get hands on during the con. So that puts me in the &ldquo;noob&rdquo; category.

Anyways, I went home for Christmas, back to Oregon. Had a good time, got some good presents, yup... everything was good. New Years is coming up. 2007... yeah, the whole millennium thing is wearing off. As for the key chain, I got a cool skeleton key chain for Christmas that is almost impossible to fit in my pocket, but oh so worth it.

            	Well, I am home. Not actually, I&rsquo;m in the U.s. waiting for my flight to NOVA. I have a very interesting flight, more so than usual. First things first: No, the person next to me wasn&rsquo;t an old lady that wanted to talk my ear off or a crying baby. It was actually a mother of an adorable boy that was sitting near the window. But you don&rsquo;t want to hear about good stuff.

            	I&rsquo;m taking a time out of all the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, Japan to write a little and promise picutres in the near future. Well, once my integrated card reader decides to read xD M-class cards. I just applied the patch from HP but it still has major problems. It gets to the first image and stops reading and I get all kinds of write errors. To add salt to the wound, I forgot my USB cable to my camera, so I really have no way of getting my pictures off the camera.

            	Yeah, I know it&rsquo;s been a while AGAIN since I have posted, but I just wanted to say Happy New Years to everyone. This year is going to be a very different one for me since my wife and I are expecting in Feb. I am really excited about my future son. It is a blessing to be able to bring a life into the world, and a big responsibility. I am also starting college back up.

            	I have officially determinded 12 hour shifts suck. Whoever invented this crazy idea needs to be shot. Oh! I’ve got an idea! Instead of 3 people per day, which allowed all three to have proper recoupe time, lets make it just 2 on a 12 on, 12 off schedule! We can use that employee somewhere else! Sound like an issue of Dilbert? Yeah, I thought so too.

            	UPDATE This keyboard is NOT compatible with Windows Longhorn but sources speculate that Vista will support this new keyboard possibly starting late 2007
Microsoft has come up with a new keyboard that includes a curious button. This keyboard is said to have already been distributed to all of their employees globally. Room362 reporters followed one of the Redmond employees home in the chance that he/she might leak information on a global release date or possibly a picture of the keyboard.

In this bold move they have enticed new blood to this awesome distro such as the renowned Silent_Bob who now goes under the alias thesb to avoid FBI and CIA warrants, but that is another story altogether. (Which I will follow-up on if you, the reader, comment and tell me to) But back to Gentoo.

            	Age of Empires II - Age of Kings. That is a great game. It has something that not a lot of games have these days. Which is replay value. Once you beat a game, that is it. No more fun. You know all the secrets.
That is where MMORPG came into the picture. But still most of them are still lacking. You can get to Level 60 or Level 70 and you have reached the top.
