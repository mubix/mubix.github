    <description><![CDATA[Alright you all have heard of some of the annoying items that make ThinkGeek a one stop shop for cube warfare, such as the Annoy-a-tron and the Phantom Keystroker. Well nothing can hold a candle to the BSODomizer. Along the lines of the Annoy-a-tron and the Phantom Keystroker, this device is hardware and messes with your target on a timer based method. But what gets added to the mix is the fact that it has an IR reciever as well, so while you are giggling in your cube trying not to bust up laughing, you can actually use any Universal Remote set to the Sony TV code, a TV-B-Gone (Mitch Altman’s awesome invention), or even a computer that it set to send that signal from it’s IR port.]]></description>
