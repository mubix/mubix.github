    <description><![CDATA[It seems like every week there is a new compromise of some service or another. But as a user what are you supposed to do with this knowledge? Here are some suggestions on things to do or think about when reacting:
Do you use the password you use there anywhere else? Think about starting to use a password manager like LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, or a product like Yubico. This way you can very easily use different passwords for different sites.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Penetration Testing / Red Teaming requires the use of a lot of tools. I don&rsquo;t mind getting called a &ldquo;script kiddie&rdquo; because I can accomplish more and faster when I don&rsquo;t have to code every single task I need to do. This post is to point out companies that make this possible and give a small bit of thanks.
(If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to convince a company to give something away for free, you can understand how big this really is)Â Some give a lot, some only one tool, but even one is more than some.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[When Google Reader decided to remove everything it was good for, we all scrambled to find new homes for things we wanted to share. Tumblr became a place that most of us flocked. I&rsquo;ve found Tumblr to be not a very good substitue for Google Reader&rsquo;s functionality (IMHO).
The other day, carnal0wnage told me about a service called &lsquo;Buffer&rsquo;, and all this thing does is do scheduled tweets, but it has one distinct feature, not only is it focused around the sharing of links, it works (if you install the browser plugin/extension) INSIDE OF GOOGLE READER ;-) So you can be reading a feed item, push a button and not have to open a page or another app, it&rsquo;s pretty much all right there.]]></description>

Dave Shackleford recently posted an excellent blog entry titled âOne for the n00bsâ: http://daveshackleford.com/?p=277
It relates the security community to a high school cafeteria. Itâs a good read and pretty dead on. I want to echo his sentiments, âI got my OWN lunch table.

I was reading Brooke Crothers&rsquo; story on the Apple &lsquo;gag&rsquo; order [1] and couldn&rsquo;t help but think of how Apple has created an almost similar situation. Everyone wants to know what Apple is up to, can&rsquo;t stop talking about it.
