      <description>This is my wife&amp;rsquo;s first Mother&amp;rsquo;s day, so if you could send her a message on Yahoo that says &amp;ldquo;HAPPY MOTHERS DAY FROM ROBERT&amp;rdquo; I would greatly appreciate it. I am trying to get her whole screen filled up with random people saying Happy Mothers Day. You see, I try to be as inventive as I can on holidays so that I can suprise her. So please, help me out. Her nick is (Thanks for your support she loved it) .</description>

      <description>My wife and I did our first ultrasound today and IT&amp;rsquo;S A BOY!! When you decide that it is a good idea to send cash and gifts (jedi mind trick) &amp;hellip; just email me at jd.mubix AT g m a i l DT c o m . In the mean time, start saving, my son is going to college, and yes, you are required by law to pay his way through college and any credit card bills he may incur going to frat parties and gaining his higher education ;-)</description>
