                <p>In early August of 2017 <a href="https://twitter.com/mubix/status/892760622563241988">I posted a few tips to Twitter regarding interviewing and getting hired in general</a>. I&rsquo; pasting them here to preserve them. I only had 140 characters to make these, and I think there is a lot more you can do, but 30 tips is a good start.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't post obvious CFAA violations to social media</li>
<li>If you go in without a job and a chip on your shoulder, you'll leave the same way</li>
<li>If you don't ask follow up questions, I won't have any either, like &ldquo;would you like the job?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Exaggerating on your resume isn't a good idea, but if you do, be ready to explain it</li>
<li>The company is going to look at your social media. Privacy concerns? Don't post publicly. Don't get sassy in the interview about it.</li>
<li>Dropping a vuln in the company during the interview is a stupid move. (Personal experience)</li>
<li>Your attire matters. If you look like you just got out of bed, I'll probably just let you go back to it.</li>
<li>Being honest about not knowing something is great. Emailing after the interview that you researched it and now understand it is AWESOME!</li>
<li>It is always ok to ask why you didn't get the job and where you can improve. Unfortunately straight answers aren't always possible.</li>
<li>Like college, trying many types of Infosec jobs will make you better at all of them.</li>
<li>Stay humble.</li>
<li>If you were referred by a friend that works there already, respect the fact that you are representing them as well.</li>
<li>Making money is better than not. If you think you are too good to be a Walmart greeter, you are probably too good for this job too.</li>
<li>Try not to take it personally if you don't get the job today. You might be able to apply later. You won't if you lash out.</li>
<li>Contributions to open source projects isn't required, but is a good way to demonstrate values, skills, and mindset.</li>
<li>Don't whine and complain during an interview. It's ok to point out deficiencies, or answer why you left your last job but keep it brief.</li>
<li>Set expectations and ask questions like: Can I ping you if I haven't heard from you in a week? What should I wear to the interview</li>
<li>Minimal self deprecation is fine, but if you spend the whole interview talking about how much you suck, I'll believe it.</li>
<li>Include &ldquo;Selected Accomplishments&rdquo; part in your resume. 2-4 things that you are particularly proud of, doesn't have to be done at work.</li>
<li>The question &ldquo;where do you want to be / doing 2/4/10 years&rdquo; is a standard question. &ldquo;I don't know&rdquo; is ok, but a prepared answer is better.</li>
<li>Sarcasm is taken differently by everyone. Might go over good or bad. If it's how you deal w/ nervousness, practice interviewing more.</li>
<li>Practice interviewing. Find someone that will give you candid feedback and interview for positions you want with them.</li>
<li>Don't take an interview call in a crowded or loud place. Rescheduling is totally ok as long as it's done with more than 24 hours notice.</li>
<li>The saying &ldquo;It's not what, but who you know&rdquo; is unfortunately true a lot of times. But it is because <em>who</em> you know can vouch for <em>what</em> you know.</li>
<li>Just because someone is a manager doesn't mean they can't run circles around you technically and are just acting dumb. (Personal experience)</li>
<li>If your LinkedIn profile does not match up with your resume, you will probably be asked about it. (i.e. degree, certs, jobs mismatch)</li>
<li>Ask about travel and feel free to ask to talk to potential co-workers about travel and other topics to get the ground truth.</li>
<li>Offer letters and nearly all hiring / new-hire documents are contracts. You can &ldquo;X&rdquo; out anything you don't agree with. $employer will have to approve the change.</li>
<li>When asked to list one or more strengths or weaknesses: Strengths: stay humble, Weaknesses: share how you are working to get better</li>
<li>Everything on the Internet is suspect. Trust but verify right? Learn things for yourself. Blog, tweet, share how/what you learned. YMMV.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have some yourself? I would love to add it! Please just tweet a reply via Twitter to me and I'll get it added. Thanks!</p>
