The above is Morse code. But anyways, we release the first episode of SploitCast yesterday night and we already have 1164 diggs. Which is pretty exciting. A lot of people have said quite a few good things about what we are doing.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>December 2nd, I drove down to Williamsburg VA to meet up with the guys from Hak.5 and Frank Linhares. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know. Hak.5 is an IPTV (Vidcast) show, which basically boils down to a TV show on the internet. Anyways, I got to meet up with these fellas and a couple other interesting people. While I was there, I had the privilege of helping out not only in the live techPhile podcast by Frank Linhares, but also the &lsquo;glue&rsquo; segments of Ep 5 of Hak.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Well if you were wondering about me, I didn&rsquo;t die. I am working on a super secret project for Frank Linhares of techPhile.ca
But don&rsquo;t tell anyone! That is secret squrrell news. I have also submitted some logo ideas for the new Auditor Security Collection. You can vote for me: HERE
I also got a HP dv1420us which, so far, I really like. It doesn&rsquo;t like linux too much, but it is challenging me to learn more about the kernel and other aspects of linux to fix the problems.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I am proud to announce that TechTV, the cable television channel that we know and USED to love might just be making a comeback. In an ‘Aliens’ sort of revival, a year and a half after they were pwnd ‘merged’, might be popping out on top of G4. For starters they are bringing back “Call for Help” with Leo Leporte. First seen on KevinRose.com which is a blog written by, yup you guessed it Kevin Rose, the next move is that the G4 Founder and CEO who engineered the dumbass move ‘merger’ has been FIRED!</p></div>
