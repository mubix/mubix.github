      <description>Everyone has their list of hostnames they brute force domains with. In my last post I even mentioned a few ways to use one with XARGS or PARALLEL. But one fact about wordlist brute forcing is that there is no &amp;ldquo;one list to rule them all&amp;rdquo;. But over the years of doing DNS record collection I have noticed one thing, most domains have a large number of short hostnames that are easy to remember, usually 4 characters or less.</description>

      <description>Update 1: No this doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be in memory since you control the system but it was a fun challenge
Update 2: The info from the &amp;lsquo;adduser&amp;rsquo; payload says &amp;lsquo;Create a new user and add them to local administration group&amp;rsquo; - I&amp;rsquo;m guessing since I ran this on a DC is why I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this but it is something to keep in mind when running this script.
Update 3: Here is a powershell way of doing things from a CSV, you can do some passwords in the CSV and keep it for reference too.</description>

      <description>Chris Gates wrote a blog post about the &amp;lsquo;getvncpw&amp;rsquo; meterpreter script. I ran into the same issue on Penetration Tests in the past but didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about the wacked out version of DES that RFB (the VNC protocol) was using. Not being a fan of manually editing a binary and compiling each time I had a password to crack I wanted to find another way, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to.</description>
