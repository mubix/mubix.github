      <description>I am way late to the game on this, but if you have a blog, a twitter handle, or even better (in this specific case) a CISSP, please support Wim Remes (@wimremes), as he has submitted to become a member of the (ISC)2 Board of Directors.
On twitter use the hashtag: #wim4board
Lets help the certifications, especially the one with so much corporate/gov acceptance, get better.
