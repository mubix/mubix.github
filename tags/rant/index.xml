      <title>A Few Changes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For nearly a year I left a CoinHive miner up on the blog so that people that didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like or couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford a way to support the blog could do so via a bit of CPU power. Unfortunately during that time lots of malware started to use services like coinhive and I quickly started recieving warning that my site had been &amp;ldquo;hacked&amp;rdquo; or was showing up as malicious (har har). Well, finally got off my butt and removed it. Sorry to my readers who had to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More later! Lots of fun stuff to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2015/time/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is a one-time non-renewable precious resource you are given. It is ok to be greedy, selective, and even snobbish about how, and with whom you spend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it helps, think of your time as a vault, money is withdrawn at a constant rate by people as you spend it, but you are not allowed to look inside to see how much you have left. It could be a billion dollars, it could be .25 cents. If it were money, who would you spend it on if that were the case? Most likely you would be more cautious on who and what you spent any amount on.  (This is not to say you live a hermit, but pushing you to actively choose what you want instead of letting life happen and spending your resource)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, respect other&amp;rsquo;s choice to spend their time with you. I know we don&amp;rsquo;t always acknowledge it, but we should be a bit more cognizant of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually dismiss it nonchalantly, in English, with simple phrasing changes like &amp;ldquo;Thank you for spending THE time&amp;rdquo;. When we should probably say &amp;ldquo;Thank you for spending YOUR time&amp;rdquo;. I have heard it both ways and much more the latter, but it just struck me as I was writing the close to this blog post that I was about to do what I had just warned against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in closing, thank you for spending your precious moments reading my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R5 Industries</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2015/r5-industries/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 12:02:10 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2015/r5-industries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently took the plunge and joined a startup called R5 Industries. I wanted to say thanks for all the well wishes that I received on social media. It has certainly calmed my nerves about the choice ;-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of people ask what R5 Industries does. Our primary selling point is AntigenC2, which is a really Command and Control detection product (no agents). But we also do Red Team assessments and some other fun toys if you are interested, contact@r5industries.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More info here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://r5industries.com/&#34;&gt;http://r5industries.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thats the end and last sales pitch you&amp;rsquo;ll get from me on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I make the move?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While, I loved life as an internal Red Team member (highly recommended, if you need reasons why make sure you watch Chris Gates&amp;rsquo; talk at RuxCon: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ruxcon.org.au/speakers/#Chris&#34;&gt;https://ruxcon.org.au/speakers/#Chris&lt;/a&gt; Gates ) where I got to help steer the boat of a Fortune 10 company, I had a number of opportunities that I had to turn down because of it, even though my higher ups went above and beyond to give me as much latitude as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a bunch of crazy project ideas that I wanted to see come to life over the years, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would have ever had the time to see them become anything more than mythical ideas without this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, wish me luck, send me work (as I can finally accept it ;-) [through R5 of course]) and look out for some pretty wacky ideas and products that I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here without you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hacking Advice For @Krystropolis</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2015/hacking-advice-for-krystropolis/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:35:28 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2015/hacking-advice-for-krystropolis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was asked by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/krystropolis&#34;&gt;@Krystropolis&lt;/a&gt; for a &amp;ldquo;Hello&amp;rdquo; and maybe some hacking advice, see tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mubix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@mubix&lt;/a&gt; I have my class in 4 hours.  Would you be willing to post a &amp;#39;hello&amp;#39; and maybe some hacking advice for my class demo? &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PSUBehrend?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#PSUBehrend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTF?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#CTF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Krystal Elliott (@krystropolis) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/krystropolis/status/647070576528502785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 24, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I thought about it on my entire 1 hour drive home from just turning in my badge and laptop from a big corporation to go work at a start up. I thought about talking about ethics and data handling, to Geo-politics. I mean, what kind of hacking are we talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally ended up thinking about what would have been the best advice for me, growing up, for &amp;ldquo;how to learn hacking&amp;rdquo;, and I boiled it down right before I pulled into my drive way to two words: &amp;ldquo;Build It&amp;rdquo;. For me personally, I didn&amp;rsquo;t start to really understand attackers, attacks, or even simple defense strategies until I started to try to build it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many hackers (and mechanics, my father included) they started by taking things a part first, then putting them back together (usually with a few extra screws or parts that &amp;ldquo;didn&amp;rsquo;t matter&amp;rdquo; on the side). But for me, I learned best, by building from scratch. This went from stealing RAM for the &amp;ldquo;old junk&amp;rdquo; computer locker from my high school to upgrade my Mom&amp;rsquo;s 95 Mhz Pentium (OH YA!) - in my defense, the computer science teacher told me that I could take anything I needed to build a computer and he didn&amp;rsquo;t specify the physical location that computer had to be in - all the way to working on the sensor grid for the Marine Corps networks when I helped at the MARCERT as a level 1 tech. I even convinced a few of the Hak5 crew at the time to let me build Gentoo (Stage 3 baby!) on their laptops because it was tons faster (once everything compiled 10 years later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man do I ramble. Point is. If you want to learn hacking, or how to hack, you need to know a system inside and out first. &lt;a href=&#34;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/system&#34;&gt;System (noun)&lt;/a&gt; in it&amp;rsquo;s most basic sense. The best penetration testers / hackers I have ever known are the ones that have rebuilt their labs/phone/widget for the 500th time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: I have had a few comments, about the post already. But what I forgot to point out is that by building a system or network you not only get to know the ins and outs of how it works, and what shortcuts you had to take to get it to actually work, but also the appreciation of what it took for you to build it, the hours/research that went into it, how it connects to other systems and clients, and finally what kind of business impact it could or does have on actual corporations. These are core skills to be an effective communicator of risk and need, while keeping compassion for the requirements and business impact. Highly sought after skills in the job market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Internets Own Boy</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2014/the-internets-own-boy/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 11:26:38 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2014/the-internets-own-boy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me knows that I live in a tiny world of offensive security, so much so that I miss large world events entirely. (Like elections and hurricanes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Aaron Swartz, or even 1% of what he was doing in the world to make it a better place and for that I am ashamed. I will do better, to look around, see what needs to be changed in this world and make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a Documentary about the life of Aaron Swartz. If you live under a similar rock as I, you can start here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch, learn, share, and help continue a legacy that Aaron started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go home InfoSec, you&#39;re drunk</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2014/go-home-infosec-youre-drunk/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2014 11:26:38 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2014/go-home-infosec-youre-drunk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying this post is easy for me to write in one facet as I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a heavy drinker or much enjoyed the taste of alcohol. So if you need a reason to disregard what I say next, I leave the door open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still pretty much a runt in the infosec community as I didn&amp;rsquo;t even begin learning computers (outside of playing games on them) until 2005. However, one thing that has nagged at me for a long time is the intertwined nature of hacking/infosec and drinking. Its almost a right of passage in the common fraternity style. The problem lies in the fact that you don&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;graduate&amp;rdquo; and leave those parties behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have certainly partaken in my share of parties and consumption, even with that nagging feeling in the back of my head. It didn&amp;rsquo;t really take root until just recently. I was at a conference where a student (who was not 21) that looked very much like an older version of my oldest child said that he was going to skip dinner to go get wasted with XYZ &amp;ldquo;Infosec Rockstar&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That scared me into thinking that if my son goes into Infosec he will be basically expected to drink like an alcoholic. How can I want my kid to be expected (not forced) to drink a shot on stage if he gets accepted to speak at DEF CON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We (the infosec community) are few, and we loose too many to idiotic things like drug overdose, drinking and driving, and other stupidly preventable crap&lt;/strong&gt;. For that reason I actually don&amp;rsquo;t want to share the thing I feel so passionate about with my own kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My call to action is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a conference goer&lt;/strong&gt;, try going one con completely dry, and if you already do, maybe ask friend to join you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are speaker&lt;/strong&gt;, enough of the drinks on stage and drinking games. Do you really want the next generation, those you are trying to teach, to remember that part of your talk instead of the rest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a conference organizer&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe a completely dry day at the con? or an AA meeting space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a podcaster&lt;/strong&gt;, if you drink during the cast, make it about the taste and selection, instead of how wasted and totally useless the next hour of your listeners life will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ShmooCon runs an AA meeting at the con&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets stop losing our friends and family because we are too weak to say &amp;lsquo;no thank you&amp;rsquo; when someone approaches the dais with a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brass Tax on Chrome</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/200893brass-tax-on-chrome-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2008 15:58:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/200893brass-tax-on-chrome-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So there is already an exploit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&#34;&gt;http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are naysayers: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/&#34;&gt;http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is the truth: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html&#34;&gt;http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the design of the tabs and address bar, but I can do that with a theme in firefox. I want my add-ons, even with the memory problems. Chrome is great for Mom and Pap, but for “Internet Power Users” it falls lightyears short on features. So where is the brass tax?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox &amp;gt; (INSERT CHROME HERE) &amp;gt; Opera &amp;gt; Safari &amp;gt; IE7 &amp;gt; IE8 &amp;gt; IE6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Yousif Yalda has made it to the coveted “Stupid People” link category, where until now was solely held by Ashley Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the hits just keep rolling in:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where do people find the time?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently was Stumbling and happened across the following video. Now, when people use StumbleUpon they are usually bored and aren’t really contributing to the world as we know it. It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comcast Cares?</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/2008722comcast-cares-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2008 17:28:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/2008722comcast-cares-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after my last post, which autotwittered, I got a reply from a guy by the name of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=Frank+Eliason&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&#34;&gt;Frank Eliason&lt;/a&gt;, who goes by the handle “&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/comcastcares&#34;&gt;ComcastCares&lt;/a&gt;” on Twitter. And this is how the converation went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix: Blogged Comcast: The start of a new series &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/6jrvhe&#34;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/6jrvhe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 days ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix I would like to help. Email me *********[snipped]@cable.comcast.com (new email: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com?subject=I%20have%20a%20problem%20with%20comcast%20%20can%20you%20help%3F%20-%20Referred%20by%20Room362.com&#34;&gt;We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 days ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix: @comcastcares it shouldn’t come to the point where you need to help. I expect a certain level of service for the golf time I am paying for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;about 3 hours later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix The golf time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 minutes later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix: @comcastcares the premium that I pay monthly helps pay for Comcast execs trips to the golf course&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;about 1 hour later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix Oh! I have not been golfing in a long time. Actually I do not know any golfers here. I guess I should make more friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after I’m done insulting the guy, he still goes out of his way to help me out. The very next day after this twitter conversation happens, a “gumbling” as my wife put it, contractor came to my house and put the cable in the ground. So I would like to give notice to Comcast: Frank Eliason is the best employee you have, if he every leaves or gets fired, I’m switching providers. To those who have problems with Comcast and their customer support, click the email link above and Frank will fix any problem you have, or at the very least he will know who to contact and with get things actually moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Frank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mubix&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone Apps vs iPhone Web Apps</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/2008721iphone-apps-vs-iphone-web-apps-html/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am truely getting tired of iPhone &amp;ldquo;Web Apps&amp;rdquo;. I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone. They do have a pretty interface and I have to give props to some of the design developers, but does this seem more of a copout to anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example. I LOVE Remember the Milk. It is probably the best task system out there in my opinion. I have for the longest time tried to get tasks on my phone and have it integrate into my calendar. So I was very excited about the new iPhone and the possibility that there would be a killer app for calendar / todo syncing with the service I already love, RTM. To my shock I found they had a Web App. What does this do for me? I now can add tasks to my to do and RTM can email or text me when something comes up. I find this pointless, because I can simply add tasks with a full qwerty keyboard at the nearest computer with a internet connection. PLUS to add to it, RTM wants me to &amp;ldquo;Go Pro&amp;rdquo; in order to&amp;hellip; use their WEBSITE? Hmm, pay 25 dollars and use their iPhone friendly web site, or just use their normal site from my iPhone&amp;hellip;. I am not against paying for a product, and I am especially not against supporting a developer, but don&amp;rsquo;t make me pay for VISITING YOUR WEB SITE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that a lot of these &amp;ldquo;Web Apps&amp;rdquo; are a complete waste of developers time, instead give me an ACTUAL iPhone App! Now, if Apple is charging all kinds of money to be published to the App Store than I retract all I have said. If not, you are missing the boat people, charge 9.99 a pop and make an iPhone app that is worth downloading. I promise that I won&amp;rsquo;t be the only one pushing that &amp;ldquo;Purchase&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comcast: The start of a new series</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t like to publicly bad mouth companies, but at some point, Comcast’s lack of “service” has got to stop. Well, let me rephrase that: Comcast needs to be held accountable for their utter lack of due diligence. I have been a Comcast customer by default ever since they swallowed the portion of Adelphia that held my area. I say this because only recently, have I actually had a choice in the matter. So, without further ado, here is my latest Tales from Comcast Customer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently moved, I decided that even though I have a choice, incurring additional “setup” fees for switching services was not something I wanted. So they guy was there 5 days after I moved in, ran the line, and we were hot with both digital cable, and speedy internet service. I came home from work, ran some speed tests and was delighted to see that I had just almost tripled my speeds from my previous residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks go by, and this line that the Comcast installer ran from the box to my house is still strung across my lawn. I call and they say they will send someone out to put it down as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 months later, I call again; they cannot see in their system that a request to put a line in the ground was ever submitted. After 20 minutes of trying to ensure that the “Customer Service Representative” fully understood that there was actually, physically, an orange coaxial line, above ground, strung across my front lawn, that was Comcast’s responsibility, she submitted a new request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 week after the new request, I come home to a Comcast truck in the driveway. YIPEE!, nope, he was there to fill out the request for a contractor to come and put the line in the ground. So basically he had no purpose in life or in my driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 weeks after the new request, no contractor, but someone at some point came by my house and spray painted lines on my lawn where my line should be in the ground. (And no, I didn’t miss a call or the contractor coming)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 weeks after the new request, the wife is fed up and she has me call Comcast after our TV goes out for no apparent reason. Guess what I got when I called? A busy signal. That just doesn’t compute in my head. How is Comcast going to present me with a busy signal for a 24 hour service line? Anyways, the next day I call and actually get through. Now guess what they told me? Nope, they had the request, but it was for September!? The “Customer Service Representative” was nice enough to move it up to this Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Be Continued&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this event has run its course, it will be filed under “Stupid People” in the links menu, under “Tales of a Comcast Customer: EP1”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have to apologize to the whole Security community for my idiocy. Yesterday I was made aware of a post about Backtrack 3 Final coming out. The link I received was a link to Mut’s blog. While reading the post it mentioned something about an early IRC release. Proceeding to IRC I found a direct link to the ISO in the topic. Excited about the release I failed to read the rest of the topic in IRC mentioning that they wanted it to stay within the IRC community. I then started sending out a link to Mut’s post, and the link to the ISO out to my friends and the Wifi Sec mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today at some point the ISO was pulled offline, according to an email I received, due to my Wifi Sec posting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry to everyone in the Remote Exploit community, and especially Mutts, Max, and MjM. So, if you read this and see me at one of the conferences. Mention this post’s title and I owe you a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microsoft making secret power plays?</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/200868microsoft-making-secret-power-plays-html/</link>

      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/200868microsoft-making-secret-power-plays-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been hearing a lot of innovators posting to their blogs that they are pursuing new employment with Microsoft, and I wonder if they are making sneaky power plays into the Open Source market. Taking it’s best projects and plucking their leads. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KnoppMyth Creator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mysettopbox.tv/index.html#News&#34;&gt;http://mysettopbox.tv/index.html#News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: The above article seems to be an April Fools joke that I was late to the party on. Thanks to Mark for calling me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Cops - Owner/Operator - Paul Laudanski&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castlecops.com/t223152-Must_Read_Important_Announcement.html&#34;&gt;http://www.castlecops.com/t223152-Must_Read_Important_Announcement.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong, everyone needs their family and Open Source is a thankless job sometimes. I am not trying to dog on them for going Microsoft. I am just wondering if they are doing this to give these gents a job and make their product better, or just get rid of supporting competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just my rant on what I am seeing. Sounds a bit like dvorak.org/blog eh?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creators of New</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/200866creators-of-new-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2008 03:47:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/200866creators-of-new-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What happens when the lights go out. Power is gone and all you have left is your thoughts and a laptop that’s battery is quickly dieing? You write. Movies will take up too much power and it’s too dark to read so you write. What do you write about, does it really matter? You write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a part of a great many projects but I can’t say that I have contributed to them very much. But I would like to in this post, since I have the time all of a sudden, take the time to acknowledge the real people who are making things happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of we have Roelof Temmingh. His hard work and dedication to his project Maltego has created something as revolutionary as the search engine. Now, you may say that that is one hell of a statement and shouldn’t be tossed around like an Emmy. I am here to assure you I am not. Just as ArcSight, if implemented correctly and cared for is one of the greatest tools a Information System Incident Responder can have, Maltego is the information gatherer’s most valuable asset. From Intel bubbas to Social Engineers to Private Investigators. This tool is not something you can live without any longer. Why? Because your opponent is already using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paterva.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.paterva.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next project I would like to talk about is the WiFi Security mailing list. Dninja and Joshua Wright as some of the brightest minds in the field of 802.11. Joshua Wright is well recognized, but I think Dninja is less so. Both Josh and Dninja are working on incorporating Karma into embedded devices, mainly the Fon Router. The Fon is a extremely small form factor router that still has enough embedded memory to be useful for modding. Their continued research, by all of those in the WiFi Security mailing list, directly impact the 802.11 field. That impact is seen in the increased security we are seeing in WiFi devices and software every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/137/description&#34;&gt;http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/137/description&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mal-Aware team. Lance James and the gents over at Castle Cops are the main players in this team but collaboration from around the world is done on these mailing lists. Closely working with the FBI and other federal and foreign agencies. The brain power that make up the list of email addresses joined together in this list could swell any room. Like mythological super heroes, they dedicate their free time to making the internet a safer place each and every day. [&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mal-aware.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.mal-aware.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mal-aware.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.mal-aware.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least is the crew over at Hak.5. Darren, Wess, Ally, Paul, and the latest addition Matt. I probably wouldn’t be as ingrained in the “Hacker” world as I am now without these guys. The videos they produce on such a limited budget are entertaining and, in my opinion, rival the professionalism of Hollywood. What they produce is always innovative and informative. Even if they mod the Guitar Hero guitar every other episode. Even though they criticism from all angles, they continue to produce and put out a video podcast that is as of yet unmatched in it’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5.org&#34;&gt;http://www.hak5.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I am writing this post, other than boredom, is to sort of tip my hat in humility to these innovators. Some of the readers of my blog think highly of me. I wish only to transfer that respect to those who deserve it. I am humbled to be apart of such amazing projects and be witness to their impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Rob Fuller (a.k.a. Mubix)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. So basically, buy Maltego (or get your company/school to), join the WiFi Sec and Mal-Aware mailing lists, and watch Hak.5. Support these projects in any way you can, because they have already supported you in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oregon Offers Tuition Waiver</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oregon’s State Legislature passed a law that provides a full-tuition waiver for a bachelor’s or master’s degree at an Oregon University System institution for children or spouses of service members who died on active duty, became 100 percent disabled in connection with military service, or died as a result of a disability sustained on active duty&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facebook chat - All that and a bag of cheesy poofs</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/2008423facebook-chat-all-that-and-a-bag-of-cheesy-poofs-html/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. I have to admit, they did the Facebook chat right. I like how it looks and how it works. I would only change one this and allow chats to disembark from the status bar, but other than that, congrats. It is actually keeping me on Facebook longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/438411/4879756/uploads/logo_facebook-rgb-7inch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough brown nosing, here are the pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO&lt;/strong&gt;: very well done layout - clean, crisp and not in the way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CON&lt;/strong&gt;: I have no idea when one of my friends sign on or off, it would be nice to have to show something simple as - Bob signed on, and have it as an option to turn off for those who have reached their 5000 friend limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO&lt;/strong&gt;: I now have access to all of those old friends and people that I have lost touch with over the years and didn’t know their email or IM address. This was already the case, but IMs are much more inviting to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CON&lt;/strong&gt;: Like I said above, it would be nice if I could dock and undock the IM windows. being stuck to the bottom kinda gets annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think that Facebook is littered with a lot of useless apps and spam, but the IM ability is helping to ween me back into trying and cleaning up my profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:Alright, either the Facebook code really fast, or I just didn’t know where to click, but I have been corrected. You can undock the IM interfcae by clicking on the shiloutte and clicking “Pop Out Chat”. This will create a new window and put all of your chatting in the new window. After you are done being pop’ed out, just click Pop-In on the upper right and you are back to normal. While this isn’t the 100% solution I was looking for (Ajax floating chat boxes that could be together or seperate or tabbed)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KVM MITM</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/kvm-mitm/</link>

      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/kvm-mitm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve had an idea and I have been hashing it out the last couple days. I want a smal piece of hardware that runs basically a MITM, but a physical one. Something like those old keyloggers that you plug between a PS/2 keyboard and a computer. If it already exsists, please link me, but this is what I want it to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features of the KVM-MITM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ports&lt;/strong&gt;:  (2) DVI or VGA; (2) Ethernet NICs; (4) USB or/and (4) PS/2 Ports  &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Half male, Half female&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VNC or RDP - a remote way to alter what is happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keylogger - recording all keys pushed through USB or PS/2 Mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH / SFTP - for reconfiguration or grabbing Keylogger data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP snagger - management of using a static IP address within the DHCP scope automagically, without registering with DHCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH Client for Tunneling local services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL Tunneling client for alternate means of tunneling if port 22 is blocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iptables - keep from a scan detecting the bridged nic (0 ports open, just tunnels outboud listening)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Supply&lt;/strong&gt;: USB powered or a Male/Female plug for a standard desktop power cord&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just an idea&amp;hellip;. any takers?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/too-busy-to-breath/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is me complaining that I have too much on my plate. And, it is all my fault that I accepted so much. Here are the projects I currently am working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hak.5 Radio&lt;/strong&gt; - This project has taken on a life of it’s own, the community member run it and are currently working on a site design and back end. I really have to applaud the effort and free time that everyone on the H5rDev team has put into making the only community radio station on the net so sucessful. Check it out at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5radio.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.hak5radio.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcasters Meetup&lt;/strong&gt; - I am happy that this event is having it’s 2nd Annual event at ShmooCon 08. Last year was a lot of fun, however anyone who has ever scheduled an event of a mid to large size, it’s almost a full time job in of it self . You can check out updates at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.podcastersmeetup.com/&#34;&gt;PodcastersMeetup.com&lt;/a&gt;. I would suggest just picking up the RSS feed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EEEHackers.com&lt;/strong&gt; - Now, I am by no means the lead on this project but I am a contributing editor, and as any blogger can tell you, finding and creating content on any kind of schedule is also a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects that I have less investment in are Paterva’s Maltego (development of transforms), Karma (developing for embeded devices) and keeping this blog up to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that, coupled with a full time job, two kids, and my current job search, it is just a bit overwhelming. So, now that I have complained and gotten everything off my chest, please check out the aforementioned projects and if you wish to help out give me a ring or email.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I said that I was going to start putting more security related articles up. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s now on the wire. I have applied to join the &lt;a href=&#34;http://networks.feedburner.com/Security-Bloggers-Network&#34;&gt;Security Blogger&amp;rsquo;s Network&lt;/a&gt;. So a lot more people than just the Hak.5 crew are going to possibly be reading this blog. I may or may not be chosen to join the network, but if I do, it should be an wild ride. I encourage all of you out there floating in the cloud to add the feed to your readers and to those security bloggers out there, apply to join.  The rush begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not often, especially this day in age, that shakes one to the core. This is one of those times.  Original Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightcitiesmap.com/transcript_bc.htm&#34;&gt;http://www.eightcitiesmap.com/transcript_bc.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;dr-bill-cosby-speaks&#34;&gt;DR BILL COSBY SPEAKS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;at the 50th Anniversary commemoration of the Brown vs Topeka Board of Education Supreme Court Decision&lt;/em&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, I really have to ask you to seriously consider what you&amp;rsquo;ve heard, and now this is the end of the evening so to speak. I heard a prize fight manager say to his fellow who was losing badly, &amp;ldquo;David, listen to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not what&amp;rsquo;s he&amp;rsquo;s doing to you. It&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re not doing. (laughter).  Ladies and gentlemen, these people set, they opened the doors, they gave us the right, and today, ladies and gentlemen, in our cities and public schools we have fifty percent drop out. In our own neighborhood, we have men in prison. No longer is a person embarrassed because they&amp;rsquo;re pregnant without a husband. (clapping) No longer is a boy considered an embarrassment if he tries to run away from being the father of the unmarried child (clapping)  Ladies and gentlemen, the lower economic and lower middle economic people are [not*] holding their end in this deal. In the neighborhood that most of us grew up in, parenting is not going on. (clapping) In the old days, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t hooky school because every drawn shade was an eye (laughing). And before your mother got off the bus and to the house, she knew exactly where you had gone, who had gone into the house, and where you got on whatever you had one and where you got it from. Parents don&amp;rsquo;t know that today.  I&amp;rsquo;m talking about these people who cry when their son is standing there in an orange suit. Where were you when he was two? (clapping) Where were you when he was twelve? (clapping) Where were you when he was eighteen, and how come you don&amp;rsquo;t know he had a pistol? (clapping) And where is his father, and why don&amp;rsquo;t you know where he is? And why doesn&amp;rsquo;t the father show up to talk to this boy?  The church is only open on Sunday. And you can&amp;rsquo;t keep asking Jesus to ask doing things for you (clapping). You can&amp;rsquo;t keep asking that God will find a way. God is tired of you (clapping and laughing). God was there when they won all those cases. 50 in a row. That&amp;rsquo;s where God was because these people were doing something. And God said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to find a way.&amp;rdquo; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there when God said it… I&amp;rsquo;m making this up (laughter). But it sounds like what God would do (laughter).  We cannot blame white people. White people (clapping) .. white people don&amp;rsquo;t live over there. They close up the shop early. The Korean ones still don&amp;rsquo;t know us as well…they stay open 24 hours (laughter).  I&amp;rsquo;m looking and I see a man named Kenneth Clark. He and his wife Mamie…Kenneth&amp;rsquo;s still alive. I have to apologize to him for these people because Kenneth said it straight. He said you have to strengthen yourselves…and we&amp;rsquo;ve got to have that black doll. And everybody said it. Julian Bond said it. Dick Gregory said it. All these lawyers said it. And you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know that anybody had done a damned thing.  50 percent drop out rate, I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, and people in jail, and women having children by five, six different men. Under what excuse, I want somebody to love me, and as soon as you have it, you forget to parent. Grandmother, mother, and great grandmother in the same room, raising children, and the child knows nothing about love or respect of any one of the three of them (clapping). All this child knows is &amp;ldquo;gimme, gimme, gimme.&amp;rdquo; These people want to buy the friendship of a child….and the child couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less. Those of us sitting out here who have gone on to some college or whatever we&amp;rsquo;ve done, we still fear our parents (clapping and laughter). And these people are not parenting. They&amp;rsquo;re buying things for the kid. $500 sneakers, for what? They won&amp;rsquo;t buy or spend $250 on Hooked on Phonics. (clapping)  AKenneth Clark, somewhere in his home in upstate New York…just looking ahead. Thank God, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on, thank God. But these people, the ones up here in the balcony fought so hard. Looking at the incarcerated, these are not political criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake! Then we all run out and are outraged, &amp;ldquo;The cops shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have shot him&amp;rdquo; What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand? (laughter and clapping). I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else (laughter) And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said if get caught with it you&amp;rsquo;re going to embarrass your mother. Not you&amp;rsquo;re going to get your butt kicked. No. You&amp;rsquo;re going to embarrass your mother. You&amp;rsquo;re going to embarrass your family.  If knock that girl up, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to run away because it&amp;rsquo;s going to be too embarrassing for your family. In the old days, a girl getting pregnant had to go down South, and then her mother would go down to get her. But the mother had the baby. I said the mother had the baby. The girl didn&amp;rsquo;t have a baby. The mother had the baby in two weeks. (laughter) We are not parenting. Ladies and gentlemen, listen to these people, they are showing you what&amp;rsquo;s wrong. People putting their clothes on backwards. -isn&amp;rsquo;t that a sign of something going on wrong? (laughter)  Are you not paying attention, people with their hat on backwards, pants down around the crack. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that a sign of something, or are you waiting for Jesus to pull his pants up (laughter and clapping ). Isn&amp;rsquo;t it a sign of something when she&amp;rsquo;s got her dress all the way up to the crack…and got all kinds of needles and things going through her body. What part of Africa did this come from? (laughter). We are not Africans. Those people are not Africans, they don&amp;rsquo;t know a damned thing about Africa. With names like Shaniqua, Shaligua, Mohammed and all that crap and all of them are in jail. (When we give these kinds names to our children, we give them the strength and inspiration in the meaning of those names. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of giving them strong names if there is not parenting and values backing it up).  Brown Versus the Board of Education is no longer the white person&amp;rsquo;s problem. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to take the neighborhood back (clapping). We&amp;rsquo;ve got to go in there. Just forget telling your child to go to the Peace Corps. It&amp;rsquo;s right around the corner. (laughter) It&amp;rsquo;s standing on the corner. It can&amp;rsquo;t speak English. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to speak English. I can&amp;rsquo;t even talk the way these people talk. &amp;ldquo;Why you ain&amp;rsquo;t where you is go, ra,&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t know who these people are. And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk (laughter). Then I heard the father talk. This is all in the house. You used to talk a certain way on the corner and you got into the house and switched to English. Everybody knows it&amp;rsquo;s important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can&amp;rsquo;t land a plane with &amp;ldquo;why you ain&amp;rsquo;t…&amp;rdquo; You can&amp;rsquo;t be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth. There is no Bible that has that kind of language. Where did these people get the idea that they&amp;rsquo;re moving ahead on this. Well, they know they&amp;rsquo;re not, they&amp;rsquo;re just hanging out in the same place, five or six generations sitting in the projects when you&amp;rsquo;re just supposed to stay there long enough to get a job and move out.  Now look, I&amp;rsquo;m telling you. It&amp;rsquo;s not what they&amp;rsquo;re doing to us. It&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re not doing. 50 percent drop out. Look, we&amp;rsquo;re raising our own ingrown immigrants. These people are fighting hard to be ignorant. There&amp;rsquo;s no English being spoken, and they&amp;rsquo;re walking and they&amp;rsquo;re angry. Oh God, they&amp;rsquo;re angry and they have pistols and they shoot and they do stupid things. And after they kill somebody, they don&amp;rsquo;t have a plan. Just murder somebody. Boom. Over what? A pizza? And then run to the poor cousin&amp;rsquo;s house. They sit there and the cousin says &amp;ldquo;what are you doing here?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I just killed somebody, man.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I just killed somebody, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to stay here.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;No, you don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Well, give me some money, I&amp;rsquo;ll go…&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Where are you going?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;North Carolina.&amp;rdquo; Everybody wanted to go to North Carolina. But the police know where you&amp;rsquo;re going because your cousin has a record.  Five or six different children, same woman, eight, ten different husbands or whatever, pretty soon you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to have DNA cards so you can tell who you&amp;rsquo;re making love to. You don&amp;rsquo;t who this is. It might be your grandmother. (laughter) I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, they&amp;rsquo;re young enough. Hey, you have a baby when you&amp;rsquo;re twelve. Your baby turns thirteen and has a baby, how old are you? Huh? Grandmother. By the time you&amp;rsquo;re twelve, you could have sex with your grandmother, you keep those numbers coming. I&amp;rsquo;m just predicting.  I&amp;rsquo;m saying Brown Vs. Board of Education. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to hit the streets, ladies and gentlemen. I&amp;rsquo;m winding up, now , no more applause. I&amp;rsquo;m saying, look at the Black Muslims. There are Black Muslims standing on the street corners and they say so forth and so on, and we&amp;rsquo;rere laughing at them because they have bean pies and all that, but you don&amp;rsquo;t read &amp;ldquo;Black Muslim gunned down while chastising drug dealer.&amp;rdquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t read that. They don&amp;rsquo;t shoot down Black Muslims. You understand me. Muslims tell you to get out of the neighborhood. When you want to clear your neighborhood out, first thing you do is go get the Black Muslims, bean pies and all (laughter). And your neighborhood is then clear. The police can&amp;rsquo;t do it .  I&amp;rsquo;m telling you Christians, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with you? Why can&amp;rsquo;t you hit the streets? Why can&amp;rsquo;t you clean it out yourselves? It&amp;rsquo;s our time now, ladies and gentlemen. It is our time (clapping). And I&amp;rsquo;ve got good news for you. It&amp;rsquo;s not about money. It&amp;rsquo;s about you doing something ordinarily that we do&amp;ndash;get in somebody else&amp;rsquo;s business. It&amp;rsquo;s time for you to not accept the language that these people are speaking, which will take them nowhere. What the hell good is Brown V. Board of Education if nobody wants it?  What is it with young girls getting after some girl who wants to still remain a virgin. Who are these sick black people and where did they come from and why haven&amp;rsquo;t they been parented to shut up? To go up to girls and try to get a club where &amp;ldquo;you are nobody..,&amp;rdquo; this is a sickness ladies and gentlemen and we are not paying attention to these children. These are children. They don&amp;rsquo;t know anything. They don&amp;rsquo;t have anything. They&amp;rsquo;re homeless people. All they know how to do is beg. And you give it to them, trying to win their friendship. And what are they good for? And then they stand there in an orange suit and you drop to your knees, &amp;ldquo;(crying sound) He didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, he didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything.&amp;rdquo; Yes, he did do it. And you need to have an orange suit on too (laughter, clapping).  So, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for the award (big laughter) and giving me an opportunity to speak because, I mean, this is the future, and all of these people who lined up and done..they&amp;rsquo;ve got to be wondering what the hell happened. Brown V. Board of Education, these people who marched and were hit in the face with rocks and punched in the face to get an education and we got these knuckleheads walking around who don&amp;rsquo;t want to learn English (clapping) I know that you all know it. I just want to get you as angry that you ought to be. When you walk around the neighborhood and you see this stuff, that stuff&amp;rsquo;s not funny. These people are not funny anymore. And that &amp;rsquo;s not brother. And that&amp;rsquo;s not my sister. They&amp;rsquo;re faking and they&amp;rsquo;re dragging me way down because the state, the city and all these people have to pick up the tab on them because they don&amp;rsquo;t want to accept that they have to study to get an education.  We have to begin to build in the neighborhood, have restaurants, have cleaners, have pharmacies, have real estate, have medical buildings instead of trying to rob them all. And so, ladies and gentlemen, please, Dorothy Height, where ever she&amp;rsquo;s sitting, she didn&amp;rsquo;t do all that stuff so that she could hear somebody say &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t stand algebra, I can&amp;rsquo;t stand…and &amp;ldquo;what you is.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s horrible.  Basketball players, multimillionaires can&amp;rsquo;t write a paragraph. Football players, multimillionaires, can&amp;rsquo;t read. Yes. Multimillionaires. Well, Brown V Board of Education, where are we today? It&amp;rsquo;s there. They paved the way. What did we do with it. The white man, he&amp;rsquo;s laughing, got to be laughing. 50 percent drop out, rest of them in prison.  You got to tell me that if there was parenting, help me, if there was parenting, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have picked up the Coca Cola bottle and walked out with it to get shot in the back of the head. He wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. Not if he loved his parents. And not if they were parenting! Not if the father would come home. Not if the boy hadn&amp;rsquo;t dropped the sperm cell inside of the girl and the girl had said, &amp;ldquo;No, you have to come back here and be the father of this child.&amp;rdquo; Not ..&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&amp;rdquo;  Therefore, you have the pile up of these sweet beautiful things born by nature raised by no one. Give them presents. You&amp;rsquo;re raising pimps. That&amp;rsquo;s what a pimp is. A pimp will act nasty to you so you have to go out and get them something. And then you bring it back and maybe he or she hugs you. And that&amp;rsquo;s why pimp is so famous. They&amp;rsquo;ve got a drink called the &amp;ldquo;Pimp-something.&amp;rdquo; You all wonder what that&amp;rsquo;s about, don&amp;rsquo;t you? Well, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to let Jesus figure it out for you (laughter). Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve got something to tell you about Jesus. When you go to the church, look at the stained glass things of Jesus. Look at them. Is Jesus smiling? Not in one picture. So, tell your friends. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to do something. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to make Jesus smile. Let&amp;rsquo;s start parenting. Thank you, thank you (clapping, cheers)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;George Carlin is funny. Offensive to most everyone, but I think the whole &amp;ldquo;I hate everyone, so it&amp;rsquo;s not an &amp;lsquo;ism&amp;rsquo; thing&amp;rdquo; works here. Here he is on the topic of Religion:   [youtube &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeSSwKffj9o&#34;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeSSwKffj9o&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;QUESTIONS ********* Why do you need a driver&amp;rsquo;s license to buy liquor in America when you can&amp;rsquo;t drink and drive?  Why isn&amp;rsquo;t phonetic spelled the way it sounds?  Why are there interstate highways in Hawaii?  Why are there flotation devices under plane seats instead of parachutes?  Why are cigarettes sold in gas stations when smoking is prohibited there?  Do you need a silencer if you are going to shoot a mime?  Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations?  How does the guy who drives the snowplow get to work in the mornings?  If 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the doors?  If a cow laughed, would milk come out her nose?  If nothing ever sticks to TEFLON, how do they make TEFLON to stick to the pan?  If you tied buttered toast to the back of a cat and dropped it from a height, what would happen?  If you&amp;rsquo;re in a vehicle going the speed of light, what happens when you turn on the headlights?  You know how most packages say &amp;ldquo;Open here&amp;rdquo;. What is the protocol if the package says, &amp;ldquo;Open somewhere else&amp;rdquo;?  Why do they put Braille dots on the keypad of the drive-up ATM?

      <title>Multicast and some random thoughts</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2007/200761multicast-and-some-random-thoughts-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2007 12:56:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2007/200761multicast-and-some-random-thoughts-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I am a complete noob when it comes to multicast and recently I have been hearing about it more and more. I know it&amp;rsquo;s been out there since the dawn of time but I simply thought it was a way of broadcasting video across the network. WRONG. So for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, and correct me if I am wrong, a computer or device sends out a multicast packet headed for a 244.X.X.X and just like a broadcast packet (255.255.255.255) it gets heard by everyone. Also like a broadcast packet, it falls within the broadcast boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why bring this up? Because I was thinking that a Multicast scanner would be a great tool for pentesters to use inside of a network to get a more complete picture of internal services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as per the torrent. I have started assembling and organizing it. This way each item will be in an archive that you can choose to download or not from the torrent. Family is still in town so bare with me just a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NAC in use</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2007/2007418nac-in-use-html/</link>

      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2007/2007418nac-in-use-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://pauldotcom.com/wiki/index.php/Episode66#Open-source_NAC_with_Packet_Fence&#34;&gt;Episode 66&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pauldotcom.com/&#34;&gt;PaulDotCom Security Weekly&lt;/a&gt; and they briefly touched on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packetfence.org&#34;&gt;Packetfence&lt;/a&gt;. Packet Fence is a Open Source &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Access_Control&#34;&gt;NAC&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time that I have really gotten hand on a NAC. I have heard of NAC and at ShmooCon Labs, I was part of Simple Nomad&amp;rsquo;s team and Vernier&amp;rsquo;s IPS/NAC. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to get hands on during the con. So that puts me in the &amp;ldquo;noob&amp;rdquo; category. So, when I explained NAC to the team at work, they asked a question I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer with any technical expertise. So I will pose the question to you the reader: &lt;strong&gt;What do you use NAC systems for?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://malicious.link/comment.php?serendipity[entry_id]=98&amp;amp;serendipity[type]=comments&#34;&gt;Comment here.&lt;/a&gt; or email me.  Also, the Hack or Halo image has been fixed and is up: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.vulnerableminds.com/2007/04/shmoocon-07-hack-or-halo-virtual.html&#34;&gt;http://blog.vulnerableminds.com/2007/04/shmoocon-07-hack-or-halo-virtual.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On a RANT</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2007/2007221on-a-rant-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2007 15:34:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2007/2007221on-a-rant-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, every blog entry on every blog, is in fact a RANT. So, stating that one is, is kind of pointless. That being said. Here is my rant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have changed this part of my blogisphere, I have been getting guff about not covering certain exploits and 0-days. So here it is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/3193&#34;  title=&#34;Excel 0-day&#34;&gt;Microsoft Excel 0-day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The easiest way to make a unix based system (Mac) insecure:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Step 1: Install a Microsoft Product&lt;br /&gt;
as for the Windows Versions; &lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;rsquo;T OPEN ATTACHMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-While I am on the topic. Word users, watch out as well. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/3260&#34;  title=&#34;milw0rm exploit #3260&#34;&gt;milw0rm exploit #3260&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I troll all the security sites with my RSS reader, and as soon as I find something that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been covered to death (i.e. ANOTHER Excel/Word exploit) I&amp;rsquo;ll post it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting off my soap box. For those that have found my previous &amp;lsquo;rants&amp;rsquo; informative and did not send me an email wining that I didn&amp;rsquo;t cove the aforementioned exploit. I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, that’s just my take on things, I’m just another security guy in a room with a small sign on the door that says “IT Dept”. What would I know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now that I am sorta in the eZine world with the release of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5.org/wiki/Analog5:eZine&#34;  title=&#34;Analog.5&#34;&gt;Analog.5&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5.org&#34;  title=&#34;Hak.5&#34;&gt;Hak.5&lt;/a&gt;.  I wanted to tag another eZine well worth reading. &lt;a href=&#34;http://neworder.box.sk/user.php?name=rattle&#34;  title=&#34;Rattle&#39;s Neworder Profile&#34;&gt;Rattle&lt;/a&gt; and the folks from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awarenetwork.org/&#34;  title=&#34;Aware Networks&#34;&gt;.aware&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awarenetwork.org/etc/zine1/&#34;  title=&#34;.aware&#39;s eZine&#34;&gt;.aware eZine&lt;/a&gt; or lovingly called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awarenetwork.org/etc/zine1/&#34;  title=&#34;.aware&#39;s eZine&#34;&gt;.behold&lt;/a&gt; check it out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Boss! I can&#39;t come in today. I woke up this morning and found 20 inches of snow in front of my drive way.   
  
Don&#39;t we all wish it was this simple. Anyways, I went home for Christmas, back to Oregon. Had a good time, got some good presents, yup... everything was good.  
  
New Years is coming up. 2007...  yeah, the whole millennium thing is wearing off.  
  
As for the key chain, I got a cool skeleton key chain for Christmas that is almost impossible to fit in my pocket, but oh so worth it.

&lt;p&gt;To put a little bit of tech into this boring excuse for a post, I just learned of something called the Microsoft Action Pack. This is a 300 dollar investment that gets you dozens of copies of all of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s products, legit, from Microsoft. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.petri.co.il/ms_action_pack_subscription.htm&#34;  title=&#34;Microsoft Action Pack - What it is and why you need it.&#34;&gt;this link for more information&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://digg.com/tech_deals/Microsoft_Action_Pack_Subscription_%E2%80%93_What_it_is_and_Why_you_Need_it_&#34;  title=&#34;Digg their article!&#34;&gt;digg it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>12 Hour Shifts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have officially determined 12 hour shifts suck. Whoever invented this crazy idea needs to be shot! Oh! I’ve got an idea! Instead of 3 people per day, which allowed all three to have proper recoup time, lets make it just 2 on a 12 on, 12 off schedule! We can use that employee somewhere else! Sound like an issue of Dilbert? Yeah, I thought so too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gentoo enters the 21st Century</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me be the first to welcome Gentoo into the 21st Century. Creating an Installer instead of a 40 page &amp;lsquo;Handbook&amp;rsquo; was a bold and innovative move. In this bold move they have enticed new blood to this awesome distro such as the renowned Silent_Bob who now goes under the alias thesb to avoid FBI and CIA warrants, but that is another story altogether. (Which I will follow-up on if you, the reader, comment and tell me to) But back to Gentoo. USE flags as CHECK BOXES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;nuf said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back to the Basics</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2005/back-to-the-basics/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Age of Empires II - Age of Kings. That is a great game. It has something that not a lot of games have these days, which is replay value. Once you beat a game, that is it. No more fun. You know all the secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is where MMORPG came into the picture. But still most of them are still lacking. You can get to Level 60 or Level 70 and you have reached the top. You get stuck. So how does one make the prefect game? Easy make it last forever. Now you want to know how you do that? Aren&amp;rsquo;t you selfish! Do I have to tell you everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well since you aren&amp;rsquo;t going to answer me I&amp;rsquo;ll just assume that you mean yes. Well you make a game last forever by making it a game that you play with your buddies, with your friends. Make it a social event basically. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t expect a game to start dispensing beer (although that would be a great feat). But make it something that rivals going out to&amp;hellip; say the mall when you are bored, or even a movie theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you have to make it enjoyable. Make computer rivals so you can co-op with your buddy. Make more levels of difficulty than Easy, Medium, and Hard (and Legendary). Call MIT and ask for a AI with some ooomph. Put cheats in the game. For some people, cheating makes the game MORE enjoyable. For others, it does not. But at least give them the option to do it. Well, except in multiplayer mode. hmm more later&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
