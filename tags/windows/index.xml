      <title>Dynamic DNS Update Module</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Secure&amp;rdquo; DNS updates is the default in Windows, but there is an option to allow &amp;ldquo;Nonsecure&amp;rdquo; updates. I have seen this changed when non-Windows DHCP servers are used (eg Access Points), this opens a network up to some pretty nifty attacks that a Metasploit module just hit the ground for.

The module was originally writting by King Sabri, with many touch ups and spoofing capability by busterbcook

      <description>Ever have one of those topics that you know you&amp;rsquo;ve looked up 100 times but never can remember the answer?
I was having one of those moments in a recent conversation on the NoVA Hackers mailing list (If you want to join please read the instructions before requesting to join)
The question came up as to what effect &amp;ldquo;Password Required: No&amp;rdquo; means in a net user UserName is.
As usual, MSDN isn&amp;rsquo;t very helpful:</description>

      <title>SMB/HTTP Auth Capture via SCF File</title>

      <description>Recently saw a link to an SCF file. Didn&amp;rsquo;t know what those were so I went digging. Turns out they are a simple text based file that controls Windows Explorer. ;-)
Here are the examples I found via the references:
Open Explorer
[Shell] Command = 2 IconFile = explorer.exe, 1 [Taskbar] Command = Explorer  Open &amp;ldquo;Channels&amp;rdquo; page in IE:
[Shell] Command=3 IconFile=shdocvw.dll,-118 [IE] Command=Channels  This didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me at all, probably because Internet Explorer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;Channels&amp;rdquo; anymore.</description>

      <description>One of the best resources for persistence mechanisms is Hexacorn&amp;rsquo;s blog. http://www.hexacorn.com/blog/category/autostart-persistence/
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked out his &amp;ldquo;Beyond good ol&amp;rsquo; Run key&amp;rdquo; (linked above) 32 post series, you really should. But today I wanted to talk about one that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see up there:
DNVM (https://github.com/aspnet/dnvm) is the DotNet Version Manager and it&amp;rsquo;s a part of ASP.NET 5, which I believe has been inside of Visual Studio since the 2013 version.</description>

      <description>One of the problems with using PSEXEC from Metasploit (any of the psexec modules) is that it runs as SYSTEM. What&amp;rsquo;s the problem with that? Isn&amp;rsquo;t SYSTEM god mode? Ya, and normally I&amp;rsquo;d agree that it&amp;rsquo;s the best level to have, but the defenses these days have gotten better, and getting direct connections out is pretty rare. That leaves proxies, and as you know SYSTEM doesn&amp;rsquo;t get any proxy settings.</description>

      <title>AD Zone Transfers as a user</title>

      <description>cross posted from: http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2013/10/ad-zone-transfers-as-user.html
The tired and true method for Zone Transfers are using either nslookup:
nslookup ls -d domain.com.local  Or dig:
dig -t AXFR domain.com.local @ns1.domain.com.local  In the Windows Enterprise world there are a few more options. If you are a DNS Admin you can use the &amp;lsquo;dnscmd&amp;rsquo; command like so:
dnscmd /EnumZones dnscmd /ZonePrint domain.com.local  Which is handy if you can pop the DNS server (usually the Domain Controller so you usually have better things to do at that point).</description>
