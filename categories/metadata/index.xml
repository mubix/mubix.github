      <description>I was recently approached by savant, who told me that a bunch of my Twitpics had geo location in them. Larry Pesce from PaulDotCom has been doing research in this field for a while and each time he brings it up I casually checked a couple of my twitpics and came up empty handed.
But, he gave me exact references, so I went to Twitpic to check them out for myself.</description>
