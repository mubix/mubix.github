  <p><a href="http://www.hak5.org" title="Hak5.org"><img width='110' height='36' src="http://room362.com/uploads/hak5_banner1.serendipityThumb.gif" border=0 alt="Hak.5" /></a> December 2nd, I drove down to Williamsburg VA to meet up with the guys from Hak.5 and Frank Linhares. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know. Hak.5 is an IPTV (Vidcast) show, which basically boils down to a TV show on the internet. Anyways, I got to meet up with these fellas and a couple other interesting people. While I was there, I had the privilege of helping out not only in the live <a href="http://www.techphile.ca" title="techPhile.ca">techPhile</a> podcast by Frank Linhares, but also the &lsquo;glue&rsquo; segments of Ep 5 of Hak.5. I must say, if and of the Hak.5 crew or Frank are reading this; it was a great pleasure to hang out with you guys. I would also like to make some personal shout outs to each one, and because this is my site. I get to. Muhahaha.</p>

<blockquote><b>Frank</b>: It was awesome to meet and get to know you. You still owe me dinner! ;-) But seriously, it was an honor to help out with the show. </blockquote>  
<blockquote><b>Darren</b>: You have Hak.5 on lock, keep up the awesome work, and it was cool meeting you. Thanks for the invite. Inviting someone you have never met into your home is a big deal to me, thanks for the trust and respect. </blockquote>  
<blockquote><b>Wess</b>: I love you man. We need to tell Alli about us before this gets ugly. </blockquote>  
<blockquote><b>Harrison</b>: It was sweet meeting you man. We became fast friends; you and I think a lot alike. ('cept for cars: Ferrari Sucks) and I think <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org"  title="ShmooCon 2006">ShmooCon</a> is gonna rock.</blockquote>  
<blockquote><b>Jon</b>: Man, we will get Gentoo done. If you need any further help you guys got my number - Mubix â€“ Tech Support 24/7 365. Keep it real man. </blockquote>  
<blockquote><b>Alli, Paul, Harrison's Mom, and Jui-Chia</b>:  It was cool hanging out with you guys. I had a blast down there. 1 1/2 hour commute is almost worth it to hang out w/ you guys. Almost. </blockquote>  
  

<p>One last thanks goes out to all the people in the IRC channel (<a href="irc://irc.techphile.ca"  title="techPhile IRC server">irc.techphile.ca</a> #hak5 and #techphile) for making my moderation a cake walk. Except for a certain individual, all the questions were perfect and I only had to fix/deny a few of them.</p>
