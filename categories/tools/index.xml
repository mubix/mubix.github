    <description><![CDATA[You&rsquo;ve found an NFS share on a pentest, it&rsquo;s sharing out your target&rsquo;s home directories (/home) and some SAN with all of the Windows AD users &ldquo;home&rdquo; directories under /volumes/users/. You only have a meterpreter session though&hellip; enough back story, problem is that Metasploit doesn&rsquo;t really have any auxiliary modules or otherwise to access the things on those shares. Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but there also aren&rsquo;t any tools for talking to NFS shares over TCP only proxies.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This is here because I always forget how to do it
sudo apt-get install libtirpc-dev libncurses-dev wget http://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/leendert/nfsshell.tar.gz tar zxvf nfsshell.tar.gz cd nfs ln -s /usr/include/tirpc/rpc/clnt_soc.h /usr/include/rpc/clnt_soc.h perl -p -i.orig -e 's/getline/getline_nfs/' nfs.c Next part I don&rsquo;t have a good way to automate. You need to go in and comment out (w/ #) the 4 lines following &ldquo;uncomment the following 4 lines for Solaris 2.x&rdquo; and uncomment the 2 lines following &ldquo;For GNU readline support you need to add&rdquo;]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[UPDATE: THIS IS ONLY WORKS WITH THE LOCAL ADMIN (ID 500) ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD
(MY MISTAKE FOR NOT TESTING MORE)
So the &ldquo;-ish&rdquo; is you need to have the username and pass of another account that has administrator rights the local administrator account on that box. But other than that, the following image should speak for itself. (no UAC prompt occurred during the following actions)
I plan on writing a Metasploit module to do this as all it really does is starts a process as a different user and that process executes ShellExecute&rsquo;s &lsquo;RunAs&rsquo; verb.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[If you follow the exact same steps you did for Netview: /blog/2012/10/07/compiling-and-release-of-netview/
then you already have the steps needed to create a compiled version of ditto from the repo here:
https://github.com/mubix/ditto
And while the sheep icon is cute, and a nod to what ditto does, it comes at a pretty hefty cost:
Size. Now if you&rsquo;re scoffing at 408 KB then you don&rsquo;t have any issues, but I like not having to wait while a binary I am trying to push to a victim box is transferring.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[If you haven&rsquo;t caught Chris Gates (@carnal0wnage) and my talk at DerbyCon 2012 - we released 2 tools, Netview, and Ditto. Here I&rsquo;ll walk you through compiling Netview yourself, in the next blog post we&rsquo;ll go over compiling Ditto and how you can remove it&rsquo;s icon to reduce the size if you want. But for Netview it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward. First you pull a copy of the GIT repository:

    <description><![CDATA[pfSense is an excellent free way of including a firewall / ids / proxy in your lab or VMs. It runs small and fast, but even as simple as pfsense is sometimes you need a bit less complexity and speed of configuration.
Enter Peerblock and AnalogX&rsquo;s proxy. Two free tools, one usually used to stop people who torrent from getting caught by the RIAA/MPAA and the other a drop dead simple windows based proxy utility.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So it turns out that Windows Firewall talks IP addresses just like any other firewall, so if you configure FakeNetBIOSNS to tell everyone that the IP address for whatever they looked up is YOUR IP, guess what, no need to bypass the spoof filters ;-) Happy Rob!

    <description><![CDATA[One of pen testers favorite attacks is NBNS spoofing. Now Wesley who I originally learned this attack from, traced this back to sid (http://www.notsosecure.com/folder2/2007/03/14/abusing-tcpip-name-resolution-in-windows-to-carry-out-phishing-attacks/) . Wesley&rsquo;s stuff can be found here: http://www.mcgrewsecurity.com/tools/nbnspoof/
Wesley&rsquo;s stuff eventually lead to this awesome post on the Packetstan blog: http://www.packetstan.com/2011/03/nbns-spoofing-on-your-way-to-world.html
and in that post the Metasploit module to do it all is demoed. But there in lies the rub. With each degree of separation we have more and more solidified in into a &ldquo;on-site&rdquo; only attack.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Penetration Testing / Red Teaming requires the use of a lot of tools. I don&rsquo;t mind getting called a &ldquo;script kiddie&rdquo; because I can accomplish more and faster when I don&rsquo;t have to code every single task I need to do. This post is to point out companies that make this possible and give a small bit of thanks.
(If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to convince a company to give something away for free, you can understand how big this really is) Some give a lot, some only one tool, but even one is more than some.]]></description>
