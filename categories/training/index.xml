      <description>In 2012 @egypt and I taught Metasploit Mastery for a day and a half @DerbyCon . This was a lot of fun but we had to cram a TON of slides into that short period of time. PLUS we had a CTF at the end where people had to break into a corporate network (virtualized) and sell their shells, data, passwords, or flags to us (egypt and I were acting as opposing countries).</description>

      <description>Drink!!
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a training package that takes a bit of a different approach than what I&amp;rsquo;ve normally done. The training breaks down like this:
 Day 1: Local LAN based exploit (Windows) Day 2: Remote Web based exploit (Linux) Day 3: Client side exploit (Windows) Day 4: Local exploit (FreeBSD) Day 5: Network of the Seven Bells Test  Each day (save for the 5th) will focus on a single exploit, explaining it, running it on virtual machines, and spending 8 hours diving into as many detectable changes that exploit makes on a system.</description>

      <description>Egypt and I have decided to give away a spot in our training event at DerbyCon. This wonâ€™t come easy though, you have to submit an essay to us with one of the following topics:
Essay Topic Options:
1. Why I deserve a free training class
2. How I would social engineer Egypt and Mubix out of a ticket to their class
Maximum Length: ~1000 words / 3 pages. (We&amp;rsquo;re lazy)</description>

      <description>Dark0perator and I will be giving a workshop at ToorCamp coming up July 2nd-5th:
You can find us on the ToorCamp site: http://www.toorcamp.org/content/W13
Here is the description of our talk, save the bio(s):
The Art of Pivot and Persistence: Shell is only the beginning.
 This workshop is based on the assumption that you have some level of access on a target system. From that it is demonstrated how to go from that level of access to taking over the whole company and how to keep that access, surviving reboots, AV scans, and even reimaging.</description>
