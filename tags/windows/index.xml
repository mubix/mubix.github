    <description><![CDATA[&ldquo;Secure&rdquo; DNS updates is the default in Windows, but there is an option to allow &ldquo;Nonsecure&rdquo; updates. I have seen this changed when non-Windows DHCP servers are used (eg Access Points), this opens a network up to some pretty nifty attacks that a Metasploit module just hit the ground for.
![](/images/2017/nonsecure_dns_updates.png)The module was originally written by King Sabri, with many touch ups and the spoofing capability by busterbcook

    <description><![CDATA[Ever have one of those topics that you know you&rsquo;ve looked up 100 times but never can remember the answer?
I was having one of those moments in a recent conversation on the NoVA Hackers mailing list (If you want to join please read the instructions before requesting to join)
The question came up as to what effect &ldquo;Password Required: No&rdquo; means in a net user UserName is.
As usual, MSDN isn&rsquo;t very helpful:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Recently saw a link to an SCF file. Didn&rsquo;t know what those were so I went digging. Turns out they are a simple text based file that controls Windows Explorer. ;-)
Here are the examples I found via the references:
Open Explorer
1 2 3 4 5 [Shell] Command = 2 IconFile = explorer.exe, 1 [Taskbar] Command = Explorer Open &ldquo;Channels&rdquo; page in IE:
1 2 3 4 5 [Shell] Command=3 IconFile=shdocvw.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[One of the best resources for persistence mechanisms is Hexacorn&rsquo;s blog. http://www.hexacorn.com/blog/category/autostart-persistence/
If you haven&rsquo;t checked out his &ldquo;Beyond good ol&rsquo; Run key&rdquo; (linked above) 32 post series, you really should. But today I wanted to talk about one that I didn&rsquo;t see up there:
DNVM (https://github.com/aspnet/dnvm) is the DotNet Version Manager and it&rsquo;s a part of ASP.NET 5, which I believe has been inside of Visual Studio since the 2013 version.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[One of the problems with using PSEXEC from Metasploit (any of the psexec modules) is that it runs as SYSTEM. What&rsquo;s the problem with that? Isn&rsquo;t SYSTEM god mode? Ya, and normally I&rsquo;d agree that it&rsquo;s the best level to have, but the defenses these days have gotten better, and getting direct connections out is pretty rare. That leaves proxies, and as you know SYSTEM doesn&rsquo;t get any proxy settings.]]></description>

    <title>AD Zone Transfers as a user</title>

    <description><![CDATA[cross posted from: http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2013/10/ad-zone-transfers-as-user.html
The tired and true method for Zone Transfers are using either nslookup:
1 2 nslookup ls -d domain.com.local Or dig:
1 dig -t AXFR domain.com.local @ns1.domain.com.local In the Windows Enterprise world there are a few more options. If you are a DNS Admin you can use the &lsquo;dnscmd&rsquo; command like so:
1 2 dnscmd /EnumZones dnscmd /ZonePrint domain.com.local Which is handy if you can pop the DNS server (usually the Domain Controller so you usually have better things to do at that point).]]></description>
