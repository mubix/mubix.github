      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Full Disclosure mailing list has a long and illustrious past. It has played host to everything from zero days to politics. One thing that has rung true for a number of years, if not since it’s inception is that it is unregulated (save spam of course). However in recent months it has fallen pray to less and less technical discussions, and more bickering, name calling, and outright trolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this post is to let everyone know that has unsubscribed, that a change is coming. A bit of “Spring cleaning” of sorts. Please see the following FD post to see the dirt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2009-01/0960.html&#34;&gt;Post 960 - 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get back on, the wild west has been cleared. Sign up here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lists.grok.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/full-disclosure&#34;&gt;https://lists.grok.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/full-disclosure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I made a new category basically for posts that I want to keep for myself and also post for other people not to have as hard a time finding: Archiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ubuntu I have always set a password for root and “su -” up to root to run things that needed root access. Well after watching &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irongeek.com/&#34;&gt;IronGeek&lt;/a&gt;’s latest video on Labrea (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/setting-up-a-tarpit-teergrube-to-slow-worms-and-network-scanners-using-labrea-the-sticky-honeypot-and-ids&#34;&gt;click here to watch the video&lt;/a&gt;). I gleaned a new way to get to a root prompt without having to set a password and su up each time. He called it SUDO Interactive mode. And al you do is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo -i&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, and you are good. Just thought I would share.&lt;/p&gt;
