      <description>December 2nd, I drove down to Williamsburg VA to meet up with the guys from Hak.5 and Frank Linhares. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know. Hak.5 is an IPTV (Vidcast) show, which basically boils down to a TV show on the internet. Anyways, I got to meet up with these fellas and a couple other interesting people. While I was there, I had the privilege of helping out not only in the live techPhile podcast by Frank Linhares, but also the &amp;lsquo;glue&amp;rsquo; segments of Ep 5 of Hak.</description>

      <description>Well if you were wondering about me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t die. I am working on a super secret project for Frank Linhares of techPhile.ca
But don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone! That is secret squrrell news. I have also submitted some logo ideas for the new Auditor Security Collection. You can vote for me: HERE
I also got a HP dv1420us which, so far, I really like. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t like linux too much, but it is challenging me to learn more about the kernel and other aspects of linux to fix the problems.</description>
