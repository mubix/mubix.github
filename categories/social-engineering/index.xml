      <description>I got an overwhelming response to me stopping the social engineering challenges, which far out-shadows the large response I got against the challenges. In other words, the &amp;ldquo;AYE&amp;rdquo;s have it. As soon as my Maltego series comes to a close I will be starting the challenges back up again. Thank you for your support and I look forward to the continuation of the challenges, I really had fun with the first one.</description>

      <description>Well, it’s not the only answer but I will call them that because it’s what worked for me:
 Sitting a couple rows down from the line so that no one would see me from the bus line I was targeting, I waited for the bus to come. As soon as it came rolling up and quickly moved into a dash for the door, timing it so that I could cut in line to be the 4th on.</description>

      <description>Here is the scenerio:
There is a line of government, and commerical workers that are in line for the bus. The bus is late, and everyone has had a long day of work. Your target is the first person in line. The line is 75 people long for a bus with a max occupancy of 35 people. Your target is the same sex as you and has headphones in their ears.</description>
