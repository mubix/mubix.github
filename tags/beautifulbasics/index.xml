    <description><![CDATA[Lesson 4 - User Blaming Security is NOT everyone&rsquo;s job in the company. Stop trying to force the issue. It&rsquo;s security&rsquo;s job to enable, incentivize and protect.
In the Marine Corps, I was taught that every Marine is a &ldquo;Rifleman&rdquo;, meaning that any Marine, no matter their MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) - aka their job, could be called upon to engage with the enemy using a rifle or other weapon.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Lesson 3 - Detection Reality People and Honey tokens are THE BEST detective tool you have.
Go buy a Thinkst Canary, they detect me more than any multi-million dollar EDR. Period.
Let me clarify something quickly before I get roasted. I am not saying that EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) agents don&rsquo;t have a place, it&rsquo;s just that they have taken over for Anti-Virus for being mostly preventative and response oriented.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Lesson 2 - Least Privilege No one should have administrative access. All elevated access should be checked out when you need it and checked back in (automatically if possible). Just like UAC. MFA should be required, proximity or push based. And every use of a break glass account should be highly monitored

One of the greatest yet most challenging things about doing any job in technology is staying current.]]></description>
