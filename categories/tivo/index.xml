      <description>TiVo and DVRs in general have brought TV watching a long way. Some of the innovations that have come of it have made the TV experience better. Commercial skipping is my own personal favorite. But some of the other features are pausing, rewinding, and fast forwarding (after you are behind a bit obviously) and finally recording. Now, recording live TV is nothing new. People have done it since VCRs were invented, and I’m sure much before then.</description>
