      <title>User Empowerment: Password Security</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2021/user-empowerment-password-security/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;World Password Day (who knew that was a thing?) is upon us. It is the first Thursday of May every year, and that falls on May 6th this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to start this blog post, but the meat of what I want to get into is password security and the evolution over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1900s (&amp;hellip; yes people are saying that now&amp;hellip; feel old yet?), password security was pretty simple. The mainframe only accepted eight characters max for a password anyways, and it was case insensitive (many mainframes still operate this way). They also stored your password in plain text, where anyone with administrative rights (SysAdmin or criminal) could read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different hashing algorithms started to become more widely used, like MD5, LM, NTLM, and SHA1. These hashes increased that maximum length ceiling and provided a fast and more secure method of storing the passwords. However, the speed of these hashing algorithms also meant that criminals could crack them quickly too. Researchers put in the time and found that by increasing the type of characters used (from just alphanumeric [a-z 0-9], to include special characters [a-z 0-9 ;!@#$%^&amp;amp;*()] ), they could make cracking these hashes exponentially more difficult. So, &amp;ldquo;Password Complexity&amp;rdquo; made it into every policy and standard. &amp;ldquo;You must require password complexity to be compliant&amp;rdquo; - PCI-DSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What went wrong is that computers and human psychology don&amp;rsquo;t always fit into the same mold. Asking human people to select a special character means not that they will select from the 100+ that are readily available on any given keyboard; no, they will choose the ones that are most common to their normal typing, such as exclamation marks, periods, question marks, and hashtags. The other bit of psychology that goes into here, and the reason why spaces aren&amp;rsquo;t on that list; is that many websites have their own list of &amp;ldquo;acceptable&amp;rdquo; special characters. This meant your personal list of &amp;ldquo;acceptable&amp;rdquo; special characters resulted from which ones caused the least amount of problems on the least amount of sites. For example, if you tried to use a space in your password on Facebook which worked, but then you tried it on your bank, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, the following account you tried to create probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a space in it just because you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of selecting a new password yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then along came password rotations. This was a bad idea from the get-go. Password rotations came about because people would select simple passwords that would be dictionary-based and fit into their world of acceptable characters that we talked about a second ago. This would result in passwords like &lt;code&gt;Password1!&lt;/code&gt;. So, the idea went that if we force people to change their passwords regularly, this will make it so they have to pick a different password and which will reduce the window of opportunity for criminals to take advantage of weak passwords. This did not end well, and many companies are still in this phase. The result was passwords like &lt;code&gt;Winter2020&lt;/code&gt;, then 90 days later, &lt;code&gt;Summer2021&lt;/code&gt;. This is infinitely worse because instead of just a limited set of special characters being used, the majority of users would now be using a limited set of numbers (year) and words (season/month). These were actually guidelines detailed by NIST in NIST Special Publication 800-63B in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2020, an update to NIST Special Publication 800-63B came in the form of more sensible standards that took human psychology into account. The update included focusing on length over complexity, spaces as special characters, regular password auditing, and a host of other things. But even in 2021, we as a security industry are having a tough time getting people to select &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By incentivizing security through user empowerment. We can do that through a tiered approach to password policies. This can work today in any organization with Active Directory but will probably take some heavy engineering to incorporate into platforms like Facebook and Twitter. I think we can get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiered password policies would work with both carrot and stick. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tier 1: 8 character password minimum length
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits: easier password to remember&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downsides:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No VPN access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSO session timeout set to 4 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password rotation every 90&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tier 2: 12 character password minimum length
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPN access - 8 hour session timeout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSO session - 48 hour timeout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password rotation every 6 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tier 3: 15 character password minimum length
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPN access - 24 hour session timeout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSO session - 1 week timeout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password rotation every year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tier 4: 24 character password minimum length
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPN access - 48 hour session timeout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSO session 2 week timeout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password rotation only on change of status (exit, breach/incident, or team change)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downsides:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ALL admin accounts, service accounts, and standard user accounts for admins would automatically fall in this category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just an example. You can do this GPOs in active directory and simple integrations with your VPN profiles and SSO groups with most major vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing left is to give users the power to choose, either through trouble tickets or a custom form/site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 3 months, you&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised how many users have self-selected up to Tier 3 or 4. You also have a fantastic list (Tier 1) of people that need training or provided better solutions for selecting stronger passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of that, this is my submission for #WorldPasswordDay.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Four Phases of Offensive Security Teams</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2020/four-phases-of-offsec/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2020 09:30:44 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2020/four-phases-of-offsec/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For brevity, I will be using the term &amp;ldquo;partner&amp;rdquo; to refer to the customer, Defensive Team, IT Team, or other direct consumers of the Offensive Team&amp;rsquo;s output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, offensive security teams, be them internal or external (consultants/contractors), the relationship they have with companies falls into one of four phases:
The &amp;ldquo;Adversarial&amp;rdquo; phase
The &amp;ldquo;Hammer&amp;rdquo; phase
The &amp;ldquo;Friendship&amp;rdquo; phase
The &amp;ldquo;Adversarial Friendship&amp;rdquo; phase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adversarial&#34;&gt;Adversarial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase is that of adversaries. Neither party wants to be doing what they are doing. The partner doesn&amp;rsquo;t see value in the Offensive Team and only sees it as a waste of time, extra work, a checkbox to become compliant, or orders from &amp;ldquo;on high.&amp;rdquo; Either way, neither team wants to be doing what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you make the most of this phase or move out of it? The Offensive Team has to do the heavy lifting here. The partner is in this state, either from a negative experience, or lack of experience, so it is on the Offensive Team to over-communicate goals and objectives and be flexible to adjust to benefit the direct partner as much as possible. The Offensive Team should suggest modifying the engagement to limit extra work from the partner, even if it limits the scope of the engagement. Being over accommodating can help create a positive experience for the partner and move future engagements with this partner out of this phase, even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly affect the one at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hammer&#34;&gt;Hammer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Hammer&amp;rdquo; phase is where the intent of engagement is for the Offensive Team&amp;rsquo;s output to be used as a hammer. This phase is also the most common in my experience as it is mainly used for internal politics, to prove points or cause actions. For example, if a development team refuses to patch a particular vulnerability due to projected outages, a partner might pull in an Offensive Team to demonstrate the risk of not patching it. Offensive Teams do not always know they are being used as a hammer. The unfortunate result of this phase is that many times the Offensive Team has unintentionally created a negative experience for the team being attacked and used as an example. Using the Offensive Team in this way can create problems in future engagements and make sure they land squarely in the Adversarial phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are positives to this phase. The hammer phase can help to overcome prejudices and biases and open eyes to possibilities. However, it is a fine line between &amp;ldquo;name and shame&amp;rdquo; and eye-opening, a line that the Offensive Team has very little control over. Internal Offensive Teams need to take extra care to not &amp;ldquo;name and shame&amp;rdquo; any part of the company as it will spread like wildfire that that is the intent of the team and is very hard to recover from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know your Offensive Team team is being used as a hammer? Over-communication again. Setting expectations correctly about what the output should be and the goals of the engagement are. It should become evident that the more you talk to the partner about goals, whether you are being used in proving a point or if you are in one of the other phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friendship&#34;&gt;Friendship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friendship phase is when the partner and the Offensive Team have become friends (at least in a professional manner) and know each other&amp;rsquo;s teams&amp;rsquo; goals. They have realized that they&amp;rsquo;re both needed in the organization, and genuinely want to help either other achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good part of this phase is that you get more done as an Offensive Team. There is less friction to performing engagements and providing your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad part is that it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunately easy to slip back into one of the previous phases via employee turn over or one poorly worded report. Friendships require cultivation, and staying in this phase needs regular conversations with the teams and partners involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adversarial-friendship&#34;&gt;Adversarial Friendship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final phase is the adversarial friendship. This phase is when software vulnerabilities no longer hold political weight at the company, and the security goal has shifted to prevention, response, and detection. The partner and the Offensive Teams work hand in hand, many times as a &amp;ldquo;Purple Team&amp;rdquo; or Red vs. Blue, to achieve efficiency goals, such as quicker time-to-detection or time-to-eradication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phase is the optimal situation and rarely achieved. Many companies I have worked for/with have attempted to jump to this phase without the friendship portion required to make it work. However, when it does, both the partner and the Offensive Team are pushed to improve and excel beyond their previous capabilities, and pure magic can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only been in the Adversarial Friendship Phase three times in my career, and I can say that it was unfortunately short-lived. It takes the two teams actually having pure fun together to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that through this entire rant, I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention leadership, management, or executives. It is effortless to blame &amp;ldquo;them&amp;rdquo; for Offensive Teams not being accepted or forced into one phase or another. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s on the teams to define that narrative better through expectation setting and over communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Few Changes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For nearly a year I left a CoinHive miner up on the blog so that people that didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like or couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford a way to support the blog could do so via a bit of CPU power. Unfortunately during that time lots of malware started to use services like coinhive and I quickly started recieving warning that my site had been &amp;ldquo;hacked&amp;rdquo; or was showing up as malicious (har har). Well, finally got off my butt and removed it. Sorry to my readers who had to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More later! Lots of fun stuff to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2015/time/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2015 12:02:10 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2015/time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is a one-time non-renewable precious resource you are given. It is ok to be greedy, selective, and even snobbish about how, and with whom you spend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it helps, think of your time as a vault, money is withdrawn at a constant rate by people as you spend it, but you are not allowed to look inside to see how much you have left. It could be a billion dollars, it could be .25 cents. If it were money, who would you spend it on if that were the case? Most likely you would be more cautious on who and what you spent any amount on.  (This is not to say you live a hermit, but pushing you to actively choose what you want instead of letting life happen and spending your resource)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, respect other&amp;rsquo;s choice to spend their time with you. I know we don&amp;rsquo;t always acknowledge it, but we should be a bit more cognizant of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually dismiss it nonchalantly, in English, with simple phrasing changes like &amp;ldquo;Thank you for spending THE time&amp;rdquo;. When we should probably say &amp;ldquo;Thank you for spending YOUR time&amp;rdquo;. I have heard it both ways and much more the latter, but it just struck me as I was writing the close to this blog post that I was about to do what I had just warned against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in closing, thank you for spending your precious moments reading my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R5 Industries</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2015/r5-industries/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 12:02:10 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2015/r5-industries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently took the plunge and joined a startup called R5 Industries. I wanted to say thanks for all the well wishes that I received on social media. It has certainly calmed my nerves about the choice ;-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of people ask what R5 Industries does. Our primary selling point is AntigenC2, which is a really Command and Control detection product (no agents). But we also do Red Team assessments and some other fun toys if you are interested, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:contact@r5industries.com&#34;&gt;contact@r5industries.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More info here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://r5industries.com/&#34;&gt;http://r5industries.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thats the end and last sales pitch you&amp;rsquo;ll get from me on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I make the move?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, I loved life as an internal Red Team member (highly recommended, if you need reasons why make sure you watch Chris Gates&amp;rsquo; talk at RuxCon: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ruxcon.org.au/speakers/#Chris&#34;&gt;https://ruxcon.org.au/speakers/#Chris&lt;/a&gt; Gates ) where I got to help steer the boat of a Fortune 10 company, I had a number of opportunities that I had to turn down because of it, even though my higher ups went above and beyond to give me as much latitude as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a bunch of crazy project ideas that I wanted to see come to life over the years, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would have ever had the time to see them become anything more than mythical ideas without this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, wish me luck, send me work (as I can finally accept it ;-) [through R5 of course]) and look out for some pretty wacky ideas and products that I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hacking Advice For @Krystropolis</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2015/hacking-advice-for-krystropolis/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:35:28 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2015/hacking-advice-for-krystropolis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was asked by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/krystropolis&#34;&gt;@Krystropolis&lt;/a&gt; for a &amp;ldquo;Hello&amp;rdquo; and maybe some hacking advice, see tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://malicious.link/images/2015/krystropolistweet.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about it on my entire 1 hour drive home from just turning in my badge and laptop from a big corporation to go work at a start up. I thought about talking about ethics and data handling, to Geo-politics. I mean, what kind of hacking are we talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally ended up thinking about what would have been the best advice for me, growing up, for &amp;ldquo;how to learn hacking&amp;rdquo;, and I boiled it down right before I pulled into my drive way to two words: &amp;ldquo;Build It&amp;rdquo;. For me personally, I didn&amp;rsquo;t start to really understand attackers, attacks, or even simple defense strategies until I started to try to build it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many hackers (and mechanics, my father included) they started by taking things a part first, then putting them back together (usually with a few extra screws or parts that &amp;ldquo;didn&amp;rsquo;t matter&amp;rdquo; on the side). But for me, I learned best, by building from scratch. This went from stealing RAM for the &amp;ldquo;old junk&amp;rdquo; computer locker from my high school to upgrade my Mom&amp;rsquo;s 95 Mhz Pentium (OH YA!) - in my defense, the computer science teacher told me that I could take anything I needed to build a computer and he didn&amp;rsquo;t specify the physical location that computer had to be in - all the way to working on the sensor grid for the Marine Corps networks when I helped at the MARCERT as a level 1 tech. I even convinced a few of the Hak5 crew at the time to let me build Gentoo (Stage 3 baby!) on their laptops because it was tons faster (once everything compiled 10 years later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man do I ramble. Point is. If you want to learn hacking, or how to hack, you need to know a system inside and out first. &lt;a href=&#34;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/system&#34;&gt;System (noun)&lt;/a&gt; in it&amp;rsquo;s most basic sense. The best penetration testers / hackers I have ever known are the ones that have rebuilt their labs/phone/widget for the 500th time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: I have had a few comments, about the post already. But what I forgot to point out is that by building a system or network you not only get to know the ins and outs of how it works, and what shortcuts you had to take to get it to actually work, but also the appreciation of what it took for you to build it, the hours/research that went into it, how it connects to other systems and clients, and finally what kind of business impact it could or does have on actual corporations. These are core skills to be an effective communicator of risk and need, while keeping compassion for the requirements and business impact. Highly sought after skills in the job market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me knows that I live in a tiny world of offensive security, so much so that I miss large world events entirely. (Like elections and hurricanes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Aaron Swartz, or even 1% of what he was doing in the world to make it a better place and for that I am ashamed. I will do better, to look around, see what needs to be changed in this world and make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a Documentary about the life of Aaron Swartz. If you live under a similar rock as I, you can start here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch, learn, share, and help continue a legacy that Aaron started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go home InfoSec, you&#39;re drunk</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2014/go-home-infosec-youre-drunk/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2014 11:26:38 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2014/go-home-infosec-youre-drunk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying this post is easy for me to write in one facet as I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a heavy drinker or much enjoyed the taste of alcohol. So if you need a reason to disregard what I say next, I leave the door open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still pretty much a runt in the infosec community as I didn&amp;rsquo;t even begin learning computers (outside of playing games on them) until 2005. However, one thing that has nagged at me for a long time is the intertwined nature of hacking/infosec and drinking. Its almost a right of passage in the common fraternity style. The problem lies in the fact that you don&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;graduate&amp;rdquo; and leave those parties behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I have certainly partaken in my share of parties and consumption, even with that nagging feeling in the back of my head. It didn&amp;rsquo;t really take root until just recently. I was at a conference where a student (who was not 21) that looked very much like an older version of my oldest child said that he was going to skip dinner to go get wasted with XYZ &amp;ldquo;Infosec Rockstar&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That scared me into thinking that if my son goes into Infosec he will be basically expected to drink like an alcoholic. How can I want my kid to be expected (not forced) to drink a shot on stage if he gets accepted to speak at DEF CON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We (the infosec community) are few, and we loose too many to idiotic things like drug overdose, drinking and driving, and other stupidly preventable crap&lt;/strong&gt;. For that reason I actually don&amp;rsquo;t want to share the thing I feel so passionate about with my own kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My call to action is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a conference goer&lt;/strong&gt;, try going one con completely dry, and if you already do, maybe ask friend to join you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are speaker&lt;/strong&gt;, enough of the drinks on stage and drinking games. Do you really want the next generation, those you are trying to teach, to remember that part of your talk instead of the rest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a conference organizer&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe a completely dry day at the con? or an AA meeting space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a podcaster&lt;/strong&gt;, if you drink during the cast, make it about the taste and selection, instead of how wasted and totally useless the next hour of your listeners life will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ShmooCon runs an AA meeting at the con&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets stop losing our friends and family because we are too weak to say &amp;rsquo;no thank you&amp;rsquo; when someone approaches the dais with a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brass Tax on Chrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So there is already an exploit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&#34;&gt;http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are naysayers: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/&#34;&gt;http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the truth: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html&#34;&gt;http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the design of the tabs and address bar, but I can do that with a theme in firefox. I want my add-ons, even with the memory problems. Chrome is great for Mom and Pap, but for “Internet Power Users” it falls lightyears short on features. So where is the brass tax?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMHO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox &amp;gt; (INSERT CHROME HERE) &amp;gt; Opera &amp;gt; Safari &amp;gt; IE7 &amp;gt; IE8 &amp;gt; IE6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Yousif Yalda has made it to the coveted “Stupid People” link category, where until now was solely held by Ashley Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the hits just keep rolling in:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently was Stumbling and happened across the following video. Now, when people use StumbleUpon they are usually bored and aren’t really contributing to the world as we know it. It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comcast Cares?</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/2008722comcast-cares-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2008 17:28:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/2008722comcast-cares-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after my last post, which autotwittered, I got a reply from a guy by the name of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=Frank+Eliason&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&#34;&gt;Frank Eliason&lt;/a&gt;, who goes by the handle “&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/comcastcares&#34;&gt;ComcastCares&lt;/a&gt;” on Twitter. And this is how the converation went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mubix: Blogged Comcast: The start of a new series &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/6jrvhe&#34;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/6jrvhe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 days ago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix I would like to help. Email me *********[snipped]@cable.comcast.com (new email: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com?subject=I%20have%20a%20problem%20with%20comcast%20%20can%20you%20help%3F%20-%20Referred%20by%20Room362.com&#34;&gt;We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 days ago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mubix: @comcastcares it shouldn’t come to the point where you need to help. I expect a certain level of service for the golf time I am paying for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about 3 hours later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix The golf time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 minutes later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mubix: @comcastcares the premium that I pay monthly helps pay for Comcast execs trips to the golf course&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about 1 hour later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comcastcares: @mubix Oh! I have not been golfing in a long time. Actually I do not know any golfers here. I guess I should make more friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after I’m done insulting the guy, he still goes out of his way to help me out. The very next day after this twitter conversation happens, a “gumbling” as my wife put it, contractor came to my house and put the cable in the ground. So I would like to give notice to Comcast: Frank Eliason is the best employee you have, if he every leaves or gets fired, I’m switching providers. To those who have problems with Comcast and their customer support, click the email link above and Frank will fix any problem you have, or at the very least he will know who to contact and with get things actually moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Frank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mubix&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone Apps vs iPhone Web Apps</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/2008721iphone-apps-vs-iphone-web-apps-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2008 03:42:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/2008721iphone-apps-vs-iphone-web-apps-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am truely getting tired of iPhone &amp;ldquo;Web Apps&amp;rdquo;. I created the title like I was going to give them a fair chance, but they truely have ZERO integration into the actual phone. They do have a pretty interface and I have to give props to some of the design developers, but does this seem more of a copout to anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example. I LOVE Remember the Milk. It is probably the best task system out there in my opinion. I have for the longest time tried to get tasks on my phone and have it integrate into my calendar. So I was very excited about the new iPhone and the possibility that there would be a killer app for calendar / todo syncing with the service I already love, RTM. To my shock I found they had a Web App. What does this do for me? I now can add tasks to my to do and RTM can email or text me when something comes up. I find this pointless, because I can simply add tasks with a full qwerty keyboard at the nearest computer with a internet connection. PLUS to add to it, RTM wants me to &amp;ldquo;Go Pro&amp;rdquo; in order to&amp;hellip; use their WEBSITE? Hmm, pay 25 dollars and use their iPhone friendly web site, or just use their normal site from my iPhone&amp;hellip;. I am not against paying for a product, and I am especially not against supporting a developer, but don&amp;rsquo;t make me pay for VISITING YOUR WEB SITE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that a lot of these &amp;ldquo;Web Apps&amp;rdquo; are a complete waste of developers time, instead give me an ACTUAL iPhone App! Now, if Apple is charging all kinds of money to be published to the App Store than I retract all I have said. If not, you are missing the boat people, charge 9.99 a pop and make an iPhone app that is worth downloading. I promise that I won&amp;rsquo;t be the only one pushing that &amp;ldquo;Purchase&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comcast: The start of a new series</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t like to publicly bad mouth companies, but at some point, Comcast’s lack of “service” has got to stop. Well, let me rephrase that: Comcast needs to be held accountable for their utter lack of due diligence. I have been a Comcast customer by default ever since they swallowed the portion of Adelphia that held my area. I say this because only recently, have I actually had a choice in the matter. So, without further ado, here is my latest Tales from Comcast Customer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently moved, I decided that even though I have a choice, incurring additional “setup” fees for switching services was not something I wanted. So they guy was there 5 days after I moved in, ran the line, and we were hot with both digital cable, and speedy internet service. I came home from work, ran some speed tests and was delighted to see that I had just almost tripled my speeds from my previous residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks go by, and this line that the Comcast installer ran from the box to my house is still strung across my lawn. I call and they say they will send someone out to put it down as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 months later, I call again; they cannot see in their system that a request to put a line in the ground was ever submitted. After 20 minutes of trying to ensure that the “Customer Service Representative” fully understood that there was actually, physically, an orange coaxial line, above ground, strung across my front lawn, that was Comcast’s responsibility, she submitted a new request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 week after the new request, I come home to a Comcast truck in the driveway. YIPEE!, nope, he was there to fill out the request for a contractor to come and put the line in the ground. So basically he had no purpose in life or in my driveway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 weeks after the new request, no contractor, but someone at some point came by my house and spray painted lines on my lawn where my line should be in the ground. (And no, I didn’t miss a call or the contractor coming)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 weeks after the new request, the wife is fed up and she has me call Comcast after our TV goes out for no apparent reason. Guess what I got when I called? A busy signal. That just doesn’t compute in my head. How is Comcast going to present me with a busy signal for a 24 hour service line? Anyways, the next day I call and actually get through. Now guess what they told me? Nope, they had the request, but it was for September!? The “Customer Service Representative” was nice enough to move it up to this Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Be Continued&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this event has run its course, it will be filed under “Stupid People” in the links menu, under “Tales of a Comcast Customer: EP1”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have to apologize to the whole Security community for my idiocy. Yesterday I was made aware of a post about Backtrack 3 Final coming out. The link I received was a link to Mut’s blog. While reading the post it mentioned something about an early IRC release. Proceeding to IRC I found a direct link to the ISO in the topic. Excited about the release I failed to read the rest of the topic in IRC mentioning that they wanted it to stay within the IRC community. I then started sending out a link to Mut’s post, and the link to the ISO out to my friends and the Wifi Sec mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today at some point the ISO was pulled offline, according to an email I received, due to my Wifi Sec posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry to everyone in the Remote Exploit community, and especially Mutts, Max, and MjM. So, if you read this and see me at one of the conferences. Mention this post’s title and I owe you a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microsoft making secret power plays?</title>
      <link>https://malicious.link/post/2008/200868microsoft-making-secret-power-plays-html/</link>

      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2008/200868microsoft-making-secret-power-plays-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been hearing a lot of innovators posting to their blogs that they are pursuing new employment with Microsoft, and I wonder if they are making sneaky power plays into the Open Source market. Taking it’s best projects and plucking their leads. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KnoppMyth Creator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mysettopbox.tv/index.html#News&#34;&gt;http://mysettopbox.tv/index.html#News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: The above article seems to be an April Fools joke that I was late to the party on. Thanks to Mark for calling me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castle Cops - Owner/Operator - Paul Laudanski&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castlecops.com/t223152-Must_Read_Important_Announcement.html&#34;&gt;http://www.castlecops.com/t223152-Must_Read_Important_Announcement.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong, everyone needs their family and Open Source is a thankless job sometimes. I am not trying to dog on them for going Microsoft. I am just wondering if they are doing this to give these gents a job and make their product better, or just get rid of supporting competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just my rant on what I am seeing. Sounds a bit like dvorak.org/blog eh?&lt;/p&gt;
