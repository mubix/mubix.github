      <title>Getting Hired: A Few Tips</title>

      <description>In early August of 2017 I posted a few tips to Twitter regarding interviewing and getting hired in general. I&amp;rsquo; pasting them here to preserve them. I only had 140 characters to make these, and I think there is a lot more you can do, but 30 tips is a good start.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t post obvious CFAA violations to social media If you go in without a job and a chip on your shoulder, you&amp;rsquo;ll leave the same way If you don&amp;rsquo;t ask follow up questions, I won&amp;rsquo;t have any either, like &amp;ldquo;would you like the job?</description>

Created the 2018 UNOFFICIAL ShmooCon Hiring List. To get on the list is even easier now! Just complete the following form: https://goo.gl/forms/aDRYaH5wubSqWcUk1
(One small tip, first come first serve, so if you want to be on the top of the list it&amp;rsquo;s best to submit the best info you have vs waiting on anyone, I don&amp;rsquo;t change the list order for anyone.)

      <title>2015 DerbyCon Hiring List</title>

      <description>It’s often tough from both hiring and job hunters to find one another at conferences. I think this is mostly because of a couple things.
 No one wants to stand at a booth on either side and talk job stuff in front of a bunch of people and people at booths rarely get the chance to get away. It’s hard to know “who” to talk to.  So I created a very simple Google doc to help put twitter handles and links together for people who are job hunting and people who are hiring to kinda get to know who to talk to.</description>
