      <description>I posted this walkthrough to the Metasploit mailing list, but thought that it would serve well here as well. Especially with the recent iPhone 3.0 “Special” download spam I recently received. The binary comes out to a whopping 97 bytes for the stager. Would be a blazing fast download and coupled with the IExpress “hack” would make for an very hard to spot payload.
A really down and dirty explination of what PassiveX is and why it&amp;rsquo;s useful in this sort of situation is that instead of making a direct connection back to you, it uses an iexplorer process with a cool ActiveX control to talk back.</description>
