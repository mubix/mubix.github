      <description>EDIT: Switching something from “DRAFT” to “PUBLISH” is a really important step. Sorry guys.
Let me preface all of these tools with, the fact that some don’t come “portable”. To make them so, I have dropped the installer / setup file into Universal Extractor and then cleaned up the directory.
 PortSwigger’s Burp Suite - http://portswigger.net/suite/
 This tool is essential to any web application security guru’s tool belt. If you haven’t used it already it is time to get schooled up on this wreaking ball.</description>

      <description>Ok, so I am a little late on posting. Been kinda busy with my new son, work, and everything in between (mainly IRC). The reason I am posting about this episode is because I was welcomed onto the show as a Guest. If you have already seen it. Yes, I was nervous and Yes, I am ugly. Get it? Got it? Good. Ok, well I did a segment on applications that conviently fit onto a USB flash drive.</description>
