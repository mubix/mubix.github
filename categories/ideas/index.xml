      <description>There are a lot of tools that I find in my endeavors would be really helpful, but can’t find on the net for whatever reason.
 A portable version of of tshark that has ARP spoofing capabilities. I want to be able to drop the file, issue the arguments and pull the pcap back.
 A application that can sniff traffic from a specific process. Metasploit’s keylogger is sort of there as it only pulls keys from the process of which it is attached (DLL is to ‘fault’ for this).</description>

      <description>First: Using SAMBA to crack Unix passwords
Theory: You compromise a unix host during a pentest and grab /etc/shadow and /etc/password. You take the entries for root in both and drop them into a unix host that you control that is set up with SAMBA to sync authentication. You then use windows methods to extract the LM/NTLM hash from SAMBA.
Problem: SAMBA doesn’t cache the LM/NTLM hash until the correct one is passed to it.</description>
