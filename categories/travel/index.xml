      <description>Well, I am home. Not actually, I&amp;rsquo;m in the U.s. waiting for my flight to NOVA. I have a very interesting flight, more so than usual. First things first: No, the person next to me wasn&amp;rsquo;t an old lady that wanted to talk my ear off or a crying baby. It was actually a mother of an adorable boy that was sitting near the window. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear about good stuff.</description>

      <description>I broke down and bought a card reader. So check out my flickr. I have over a hundred pictures posted from the few days that I have been over here, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting more and more each day and they will all be in the same flickr set.
Well we went to Akihabara again today to return a wireless card, but they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take it back. Ghey. But I got a really cool usb flash drive and a the card reader I needed.</description>
