      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to see The Transporter 2 tonight. Normally I watch movies using an ‘alternative’ method, but for action movies it is really hard to get into it without the 13 speakers blaring heart pumping music into your face for a eyeball warping experience. I have to admit, that this movie was great, but if it had not been for the fantastic sound effects, music, and overall audible feel to the movie, I would have thought less of it. The only bad part of the movie that I didn’t like was that they added a huge gap between realities. In the first movie, you were left thinking, &amp;ldquo;Hmm, do people actually do this?” In this movie you start wondering when Van Dam and The Govenator are going to start breaking down doors. Overall good performances though. Good job Frank.&lt;/p&gt;
