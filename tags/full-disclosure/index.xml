    <description><![CDATA[Update: I originally posted this to the Full Disclosure mailing list but for some reason it wasn&rsquo;t accepted via the moderator so I&rsquo;m posting it here. First, so that the information does get out there, and second to see if anyone knows why it may have been rejected.
I was helping out a family member with their computer when it came up that they &ldquo;already had remote help software&rdquo; (SingleClickConnect or SCC), when I asked what this was, the family member said it was installed by Dell Support when trying to fix their issue.]]></description>
