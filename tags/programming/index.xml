      <description>Right now I am taking a class called “Intro to Programming”. And yup! you guessed it! The first assignment is to make a Hello World program. For those who don’t know, that is the Globally accepted first assignment for programming languages, be it HTML, Java, C++, PHP, python, or Assembly. Now this is where I get to voice my opinion of Java so far: It bites! Any language that makes you write 3 lines of code just to print “Hello World” is stupid.</description>
