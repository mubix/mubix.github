      <description>Just like it’s LOVELY auto download feature, Google Chrome slipped in a new version. I was testing out some of the latest and greatest posts of exploits for .27 and they were failing to work. Checked my version and low and behold a new version number was displayed. I didn’t upgrade, all done automagically. (Evilgrade anyone?)
 I wonder what will pop on this new version.</description>

      <description>For some reason LinkedIn has become unavailable:

 Earlier when going to LinkedIn, I was greeted by a wizard saying that they will performing upgrades tonight. I guess they didn’t go as wel as planned. As a security addict though, I always have that sinking feeling when a server is down. Especially one that has personal information about so many people.
Hope it’s nothing
Fear it’s bad
It’s nothing WINS!</description>

      <description>It’s almost that time. DefCon is right around the corner and things are coming together nicely. Here is where we stand and a rough schedule of events:
 Bloggers welcome. I got a lot of feedback asking if it’s just for “Podcasters” but we would like to invite bloggers to participate as well.
 I-Hacked.com and Astaro are our current sponsors, and I am still waiting on confirmation from two others.</description>

Phrack Issue #65 is out, as of April 11th, 2008. I am by no means a Phrack addict or aficionado on all things Phrack, and I have only read TCLH’s introduction which in my humble opinion it is close to Mentor worthy.</description>

      <description>So, a while back I wrote about a program called “Evolution”. Since then it has evolved into its new form “Maltego”. Maltego has had it’s face ripped off and remolded, and lot of work on the back end, if you know what I mean.
So basically I was teased by the creator of Maltego. He sent me these two images showing the awesomeness that will be Maltego v2 (and yes, Awesomeness is a word)</description>

An official announcement is due tomorrow, and until then, the ISO and USB images are available on torrent, and the Hak.5 Community, to include myself has really stepped up and footed some HTTP bandwidth for those less fortunate not to behind P2P block and/or retrictions. I will be writing a piece up on the Beta as soon as I get the same thing that the developers have been craving:</description>

      <description>So, last Shmoocon (2007) was my second year running at the con and we did something that hasn&#39;t been done before: A Security/Hacker&#39;s Pod/Vidcast meetup at the conference which gave a chance for their listeners/viewers to meet the people behind the mic/camera. Well, a little less than one year later and plans for the next meetup are already underway. And, as I learn the ropes of putting something like this together we will be getting better venues and hopefully down the road meetups will pop up at Defcon and other conferences.</description>

I recently stumbled upon a awesome script. Tried and test, works out of the box. Basically you open a terminal, paste this in, and hit enter.

      <description>So, this is my first time writing with ScribeFire. (We&amp;rsquo;ll see if it auto detects it&amp;rsquo;s name and links to it. But, as you can probably tell by the title, this article isn&amp;rsquo;t about ScribeFire. It&amp;rsquo;s about Logmein.com. Now, you most likely have already seen or used this service, and I have fought back in forth in my head about regurgitating information which I think people already know. However, I&amp;rsquo;ll save that talk for another post.</description>

      <description>Ok, admit it. You have searched for your name in Google, Technorati, or egoSurf.org just to see how you were ranked. You may have even gone to the extent of using RSS feed searches or services such as MonitorThis to keep tabs on your name/handle.
Or, you might be a Penetration Tester who is in the “Enumeration / Information Gathering” phase. Or a Security Professional that wants to keep tabs on what kind of fingerprint their company has out there.</description>

A design flaw found in ActionScript (Flash) has been allowed the scanning hosts via trial and error. Whenever a port is queried by Flash that isn’t open, it responds with a “SecurityErrotEvent” instantly. But, when a port is open, it doesn’t get that response for an extended period of time, while it waits for a reply to “policy-file-request”. PoC can be viewed at the below address. Now the question is: What ELSE can you do with this information once you have this ability.</description>

Secunia.com has been a great resource of vulnerability and virus information over the years for Black, Grey, and White hat hackers alike. Recently they released a BETA project that looks promising and could be the first step into a &amp;ldquo;package manager&amp;rdquo; for Windows. In there own words:
 A new addition to the Secunia Software Inspector series, the free Secunia Personal Software Inspector (PSI), is now available for BETA testing.</description>

      <description>A couple people have asked for links on where I got this portable app or that, well, all over really. Here are a few links to get you started:
http://www.dirk-loss.de/win-tools.htm
http://www.tinyapps.org/
http://www.portablefreeware.com/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_portable_applications
http://standalone.atspace.org/
http://portableapps.com/apps
http://www.kikizas.net/en/usbapps.html
Also, I gave some of the apps their portability myself. It&amp;rsquo;s a easy process. Drag and drop an installer file &amp;ldquo;setup.exe&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;whatever.msi&amp;rdquo; into Universal Extractor. What you are going to get is a folder right where that installer is, with the same name as the installer.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t use Wine. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get anything working and a pain once it is. However since I found out about the Wine-Doors project, it&amp;rsquo;s made me go back on that thought.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly new project, but well on it&amp;rsquo;s way to being an enabler for a great many users. A great many users have been looking for that one last thing, to get them over the hump of still using Windows.</description>

So now that is done, I get to talk about other things that I am getting into:
Wubi &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; Installer: http://wubi-installer.org/
This is actually pretty amazing. What it does is automagically downloads an ISO (takes a while), makes a virtual disk, puts entries in the Windows boot loader and tells you to restart. When you restart it boots to the virutal disk and installs the version of Ubuntu you chose.</description>

So, I know you guys have waited forever and a day already, but I have to drag it out just a tad more. I am going to do the work of checking into each license to see if I can redistribute it.</description>

Here is what goes in my go.cmd file from the SwitchBlade
 @echo off
truecrypt /q /v saved.pst /lo
o:pstart.exe
 So what I am doing here is connecting the saved.pst file as a truecrypt volume using /v. I am using the /q so that it doesn’t open the whole Truecrypt GUI.</description>

      <description>When I checked my Amazon account today, I was amazed to find that about 90% of the books that I have in my “Saved for later” cart have increased in price. What’s going on? I guess this raises a good question. What regulates the rise and fall of prices on the internet? Do you “shop around” for books on the internet? Or do you just go to Amazon.com and buy what you need?</description>
