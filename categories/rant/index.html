						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>I&rsquo;ve taken a rather long hiatus from blogging. This is mostly because I was fed up with the blogging platform that I had (Squarespace) and didn&rsquo;t really have any alternatives that met all of the features I wanted.
So, where am I at now? Github actually. Github allows users to create &ldquo;Github Pages&rdquo; for repositories (or be it&rsquo;s own repo). For the most part these pages are written in Markdown. It&rsquo;s late and I don&rsquo;t feel like looking up who, but someone created a project called &ldquo;Jekyll&rdquo; which is a Ruby based static page generator and then another project called &ldquo;Octopress&rdquo; popped up using Jekyll to create a static html based blogging platform.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Problems are that everyone does this whole blogging thing in so many different ways. Me, personally? I like to have a client that I can save drafts it, work on things a little bit here and there and then finalize stuff when I&rsquo;m ready to post. I have a couple dozen of these posts ready and set with final tweaks needed but my blogging software Squarespace up and moved on to &ldquo;Squarespace 6&rdquo;.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I&rsquo;ve been cracking passwords for a while and use a myriad of tools in a certain order to get the job done. I find that Cain is still my Go-to for allowing me to visualize the process and do some basic sorting (really wish I could search in-app). But I&rsquo;ve been asking around on twitter some questions like Why is GPU cracking for 50k hashes faster than Rainbow Tables (most say the bottleneck is the HDD read style and speed) and many asked what all of my compalints are so I figured this would be the best place (vice multiple emails)</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>This day and age everyone is worried about the insider threat. Internal Penetration Testing doesn&rsquo;t really test what would happen if your janitor got paid 50 bucks to put a USB stick in one of your servers. External Penetration Tests are never scoped for that sort of testing. So what is a company to do? How can they know what the risk is? The answer? Usually they guess or assume. Mostly because they are scared to find out, it&rsquo;s happened to them before, or one of a million different justifications.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Back in 2009 the &ldquo;ikee&rdquo; rick-rolling worm went around the iPhone world via the password of &lsquo;alpine&rsquo; on the root account. You are now warned to change your root password when you pop into Cydia and Rock the first time. But this thing just wont stay down.
If you have jailbroken your iPad you might want to check out a little file called &ldquo;master.passwd&rdquo;. In it, there is another user called &lsquo;mobile&rsquo; which has been pointed out since 2008 (here) on the iPhone as another account to change the password of.</p></div>

Responsible Disclosure  Direct Contact =&gt; depending on the size of the vendor and their view on security, this could result in anything from a simple thanks, a reward, to a court hearing. Exploit Broker =&gt; possibly sell, possibly not, depends on the broker.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>This is far from a new idea, however it&rsquo;s not something that is easily provable. So I had an idea this morning. I posed the following question on Twitter:
You know what I got in return? a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo; from everyone. (well I had one outlier but, who doesn&rsquo;t when you are trying to apply science to prove art) I challenge you to name another non-artistic career that people are so passionate about that they would stay in it even if they won the lottery.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>We (the security community) all know, and make fun of &ldquo;Users&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Admins&rdquo;. They are derogatory terms in our community. So much so, that they could almost be classified at curse words. (I can see the XKCD now: Security stick figure talking to IT stick figure. &ldquo;You stupid A****&ldquo;).
While I neither discount their &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; to making my day fun, I feel that a lot of people miss an even bigger threat: Policies and Procedures, or SOP (Standard Operating Procedures).</p></div>
