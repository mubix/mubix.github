      <description>Recently saw a link to an SCF file. Didn&amp;rsquo;t know what those were so I went digging. Turns out they are a simple text based file that controls Windows Explorer. ;-)
Here are the examples I found via the references:
Open Explorer
[Shell] Command = 2 IconFile = explorer.exe, 1 [Taskbar] Command = Explorer  Open &amp;ldquo;Channels&amp;rdquo; page in IE:
[Shell] Command=3 IconFile=shdocvw.dll,-118 [IE] Command=Channels  This didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me at all, probably because Internet Explorer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;Channels&amp;rdquo; anymore.</description>

      <title>Effective NTLM / SMB Relaying</title>

      <description>SMB Relay has been around for a long while. I even have a post about using it along with LNK files here:
MS08-068 + MS10-046 = Fun until 2018
Here is the problem though. Most of the tools to exploit it either catch the authentication in NTLMv2/NTLMv1 (which is not always easy to crack) or assume administrative access (because they attempt to PSEXEC with the incoming session). Well, since MS08-068 thats much harder to pin down.</description>
