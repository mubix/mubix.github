      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2012 @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/egyp7&#34;&gt;egypt&lt;/a&gt; and I taught &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.derbycon.com/traning-classes-2012/#metasploit&#34;&gt;Metasploit Mastery&lt;/a&gt; for a day and a half @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/derbycon&#34;&gt;DerbyCon&lt;/a&gt; . This was a lot of fun but we had to cram a TON of slides into that short period of time. PLUS we had a CTF at the end where people had to break into a corporate network (virtualized) and sell their shells, data, passwords, or flags to us (egypt and I were acting as opposing countries). You could sell low to one and high to another whatever. Most money at the end wins. (We used a score card with ranges to keep it even)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are doubling down on the content being provided and doing a 3 full days @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/secwest&#34;&gt;CanSecWest&lt;/a&gt;. You get to learn the nooks and cranies of Metasploit&amp;rsquo;s guts from &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; egypt himself, and operational use from me, with a ton mixed in between. I mean, just getting in the room with egypt&amp;rsquo;s beard is worth the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
