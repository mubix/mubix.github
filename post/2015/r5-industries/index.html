                <p>I recently took the plunge and joined a startup called R5 Industries. I wanted to say thanks for all the well wishes that I received on social media. It has certainly calmed my nerves about the choice ;-).</p>
<p>I've had a number of people ask what R5 Industries does. Our primary selling point is AntigenC2, which is a really Command and Control detection product (no agents). But we also do Red Team assessments and some other fun toys if you are interested, <a href="mailto:contact@r5industries.com">contact@r5industries.com</a></p>
<p>More info here: <a href="http://r5industries.com/">http://r5industries.com/</a></p>
<p>And thats the end and last sales pitch you'll get from me on the subject.</p>
<p>Why did I make the move?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>While, I loved life as an internal Red Team member (highly recommended, if you need reasons why make sure you watch Chris Gates&rsquo; talk at RuxCon: <a href="https://ruxcon.org.au/speakers/#Chris">https://ruxcon.org.au/speakers/#Chris</a> Gates ) where I got to help steer the boat of a Fortune 10 company, I had a number of opportunities that I had to turn down because of it, even though my higher ups went above and beyond to give me as much latitude as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a bunch of crazy project ideas that I wanted to see come to life over the years, I don't think I would have ever had the time to see them become anything more than mythical ideas without this opportunity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, wish me luck, send me work (as I can finally accept it ;-) [through R5 of course]) and look out for some pretty wacky ideas and products that I've been talking about for years.</p>
<p>Thanks again, I wouldn't be here without you.</p>
