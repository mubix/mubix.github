      <description>One of the problems with using PSEXEC from Metasploit (any of the psexec modules) is that it runs as SYSTEM. What&amp;rsquo;s the problem with that? Isn&amp;rsquo;t SYSTEM god mode? Ya, and normally I&amp;rsquo;d agree that it&amp;rsquo;s the best level to have, but the defenses these days have gotten better, and getting direct connections out is pretty rare. That leaves proxies, and as you know SYSTEM doesn&amp;rsquo;t get any proxy settings.</description>
