    <description><![CDATA[Just like it’s LOVELY auto download feature, Google Chrome slipped in a new version. I was testing out some of the latest and greatest posts of exploits for .27 and they were failing to work. Checked my version and low and behold a new version number was displayed. I didn’t upgrade, all done automagically. (Evilgrade anyone?)
I wonder what will pop on this new version.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[For some reason LinkedIn has become unavailable:
Earlier when going to LinkedIn, I was greeted by a wizard saying that they will performing upgrades tonight. I guess they didn’t go as wel as planned. As a security addict though, I always have that sinking feeling when a server is down. Especially one that has personal information about so many people.
Hope it’s nothing
Fear it’s bad
It’s nothing WINS! (We’re doing some front-end network maintenance, on the loadbalancer which hosts the Wizard page.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[It’s almost that time. DefCon is right around the corner and things are coming together nicely. Here is where we stand and a rough schedule of events:
Bloggers welcome. I got a lot of feedback asking if it’s just for “Podcasters” but we would like to invite bloggers to participate as well.
I-Hacked.com and Astaro are our current sponsors, and I am still waiting on confirmation from two others.
We have Skybox 208 all day Saturday.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So, a while back I wrote about a program called “Evolution”. Since then it has evolved into its new form “Maltego”. Maltego has had it’s face ripped off and remolded, and lot of work on the back end, if you know what I mean.
So basically I was teased by the creator of Maltego. He sent me these two images showing the awesomeness that will be Maltego v2 (and yes, Awesomeness is a word)]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So, last Shmoocon (2007) was my second year running at the con and we did something that hasn't been done before: A Security/Hacker's Pod/Vidcast meetup at the conference which gave a chance for their listeners/viewers to meet the people behind the mic/camera. Well, a little less than one year later and plans for the next meetup are already underway. And, as I learn the ropes of putting something like this together we will be getting better venues and hopefully down the road meetups will pop up at Defcon and other conferences.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I was a quick fan of the show called &ldquo;Jericho&rdquo; on CBS. It was one of the few shows on that didn&rsquo;t have the advertising that LOST or The 4400 had, but still competed or surpassed in some cases the level of story and all out &ldquo;Good&rdquo;.
