      <description>Since it&amp;rsquo;s Christmas and all, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post the code snippet from my Hak5 segment a bit early:
#include &amp;lt;Clipboard.au3&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;File.au3&amp;gt; $oldclip = &amp;quot;&amp;quot; While 1 $clip = _ClipBoard_GetData() If $clip &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; Then If $clip &amp;lt;&amp;gt; $oldclip Then _FileWriteLog(@UserProfileDir &amp;amp; &amp;quot;clip.log&amp;quot;, $clip) $oldclip = $clip EndIf EndIf Sleep(100) WEnd  It&amp;rsquo;s pretty straight forward, and I welcome everyone to install AutoIt3 and compile/run the above script to see what it does (although most of you I&amp;rsquo;m sure can figure it out just by reading it).</description>

      <description>Just a real quick FYI. Since I have been getting more and more into the IPTV scene, I figured that I would add links to my favorite shows. I will most indubitably be adding more, but this is a good start. Check it out over

      <description>December 2nd, I drove down to Williamsburg VA to meet up with the guys from Hak.5 and Frank Linhares. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know. Hak.5 is an IPTV (Vidcast) show, which basically boils down to a TV show on the internet. Anyways, I got to meet up with these fellas and a couple other interesting people. While I was there, I had the privilege of helping out not only in the live techPhile podcast by Frank Linhares, but also the &amp;lsquo;glue&amp;rsquo; segments of Ep 5 of Hak.</description>
