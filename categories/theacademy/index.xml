      <description>Ok, it&amp;rsquo;s not to you, but it is to a good cause. Here is their blurb:
Hackers for Charity helps non-malicious hackers gain valuable job experience by putting them to work on projects for charity. They also build computer classrooms to help children and adults break the cycle of poverty through empowerment training, and feed children with funds raised by sales of Johnny Long&amp;rsquo;s books.
This month, I thought that it would be fun to partner up with Hackers for Charity in order to raise money for the people of Uganda.</description>
