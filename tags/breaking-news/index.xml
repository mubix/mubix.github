      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick blurb because &lt;a href=&#34;http://spylogic.net&#34;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://securityjustice.com/&#34;&gt;Security Justice Podcast&lt;/a&gt; already has a great post about all the changes:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unless you have been hiding under a rock, or just started reading this blog today. You have heard about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gopc.net/&#34;&gt;GoPC&lt;/a&gt;. I featured it in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/archives/236-USB-Goodies-2008.html&#34;&gt;USB Goodies 2008&lt;/a&gt; and I love their product. Now that they have entered into a “Strategic Alliance” with a company called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thinlinx.com&#34;&gt;ThinLinX&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the details of this alliance and the future it holds aren’t clear at the moment. And of course I have my own speculations. What are yours? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kind of get the ball rolling I’ll give you a brief intro to each company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/438411/4879756/uploads/gopc_logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GoPC&lt;/strong&gt; allows you to either through a web interface, or a portable app that you can have on a thumb drive, you can login to a virtual desktop. Having the ability to take a powerful machine with you whereever you go without having to lug around a laptop is a great experiance. I plug in my USB or surf to their site on an computer and I am instantly on my own customized desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ThinLinX&lt;/strong&gt; has incorporated the power and speed of NoMachine NX into a tiny box. These thin clients are set up to only allow the connection back to the mothership and connect you to your desktop. Making it a relatively safe enviroment for you to login to enterprise email, surf the intra and inter nets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as a security addict, I tried to say away from word like “Cloud Computing” and “Secure”. Mostly becuase they have both become bad words in the industry. I plan on getting one and putting it through the ringers as it is the first thin client that I can afford at 99 bucks! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see what comes of these two companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out their press release at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gopc.net/blog/?p=40&#34;&gt;http://www.gopc.net/blog/?p=40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Podcasters Meetup @ DEFCON 16</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2008/200879podcasters-meetup-defcon-16-html/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this year marks the first annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.defcon.org/&#34;&gt;DEFCON&lt;/a&gt; Podcaster’s Meetup, and we will be doing it in STYLE. For those of you who made it out to the second annual Podcaster’s Meetup at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shmoocon.org/&#34;&gt;ShmooCon&lt;/a&gt;, we ran into some hitches (like sound), but as we grow, so do the problems. Let me start off by telling you some sweet news. We are nailing down time in a SkyBox! So we will have plenty of room, piece and quite for recording, and a nice view over the con, plus NO WALKING TO THE PARTY. We will have it right there in the box!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Podcasters,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to know as soon as possible how many already are set to go, those intending on getting set up and those who can’t make it. Also, if the idea of getting in free pushes you over the ‘going’ edge, we may be able to work that as well. Also, on that note, please forward this, like a Microshaft chain letter to any other podcasters that may be going, give them my email address so we can start a dialog and work out any kinks in their plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Potential Sponsors,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have included you in this email because I want you to understand the possibilities of this event. It will be at DEFCON 16. The most well known security / hacker conference. If you want to send fliers, stickers, drinks, money, or prizes, we can work out the details. We will be recording and broadcasting a live show from DEFCON which usually brings in 100 local and up to 500 remote viewers. It is then rebroadcast on which ever podcasters or vidcasters distribution that wants to and that could range from 10,000 to 1 million potential viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As information is updated and confirmations come in, I will be updating the collaboration site: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.podcastersmeetup.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.podcastersmeetup.com/&lt;/a&gt; . Feel free to post or forward this information on to who every you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like an account in order to broadcast your presence at the event, please signup and I will upgrade your user level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who may not know: DEFCON 16: August 8-10, 2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob Fuller, a.k.a. &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../&#34;&gt;Mubix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hacker steals Quake</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2008/2008629hacker-steals-quake-html/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a Dutch news site there was a story about a hacker that stole 50,000 credit cards (well, the information at least) and also stole a prerelease version of Quake Wars. What do you think made the title line? Quake Wars. That puts things in perspective on what is impotant. Big companies like the one that made Quake Wars have the liquid budget to chase this guy down, but the 50,000 individuals don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it bad that my sole thought after reading this article is wondering how he got into the Id Software servers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/06/hacker_arrested_for_stealing_q.php&#34;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other hacker news,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23933178-952,00.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacker reveals flaws in school website security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&#34;http://news.cnet.com/8301-10789_3-9978151-57.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Woman accused of hacking Houston organ bank indicted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
