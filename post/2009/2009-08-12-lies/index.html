            <p>When I was in middle school, I told a lie. I was so good at telling lies, and remembering even the infinite details of these lies that I could make them believable. Later in life, I learned that this skill was called “Social Engineering ;-)”, but back to the story; I told everyone that I had won a shopping spree at “Incredible Universe”, now named “Fry’s”. Even the teacher believed me. The kids made lists of what they wanted me to get for them, and I strung it on for way too long. You tell a lie like that though and you get caught eventually. As I did, and learned a hard lesson. At that time in my life I was going through some really rough waters, and having everyone “like” me for even that finite amount of time, helped me cope. Does that make it right? Definitely not. But I remember that experience to this day.</p>

<p>Why tell you all this? Because this post is both self serving (as it will make it impossible for me to lie about the following any more) and apologetic. I have lied to those I call friend. Recently these lies were told to some very good friends and I had my first physical reaction to the guilt of telling them. I was literally unable to eat that night. Enough stalling and making excuses here they are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am not a Marine Scout Sniper, nor ever been to Marine Scout Sniper school. I truly wish I had been and admire all those who have made it through.</p></li>

<li><p>I have never been to SEARS training.</p></li>

<li><p>The gentleman by the name of Fuzzy, was a gas attendant with me. Great guy, but he wasn’t an explosives expert in Okinawa to the best of my knowledge.</p></li>

<li><p>Never met the Rock Marines of Korea, or for that matter trained with any other foreign military.</p></li>

<li><p>I have never been to a Masseuse school, but I give great massages, ask anyone.</p></li>

<li><p>I was never a bouncer in NY or lived there. Only been there twice on vacation, but love the city, and the Yankees (although I have no idea who plays for or owns the team) nor do I follow them, or for that matter any sports team.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been a bartender, but it was for a base beach snack bar that I followed mix solutions on a printed paper for, so I know absolutely nothing about mixed drinks.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have never told these lies during an interview or any other formal means, but I have told them to friends and acquaintances. I would like to apologize to all of them, here and now. I originally thought I should email them, but decided this public forum was a better and a bit more transparent.</p>

<p>Are the lies damaging to anyone but me? Did I have to tell anyone? No, not really. Would someone figure out that they were lies? There is a small chance. But that’s not the point. I try to be as brutally honest as I can with people, and I want that to extend to things about myself.</p>

<p>Think of me what you will, and I am deeply sorry if I misrepresented myself to you in any fashion at any time.</p>

<p>Rob</p>
