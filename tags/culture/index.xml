      <description>&lt;p&gt;Normally I save links for my &amp;ldquo;Mubix Links&amp;rdquo; blog to keep the clutter down on this one, but I think this is one that I would like to highlight as important. The NFO, credits and summary to this copyrighted video is what I wish to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5573874/Hackers_Wanted_%282008%29&#34;&gt;http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5573874/Hackers&lt;em&gt;Wanted&lt;/em&gt;%282008%29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am against the misuse of copyrighted material, and it is a violation of  laws in many countries, including my own.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wish this video would have been published, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it would have been a very interesting video, that I definitely would have purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vuln Disclosure Summarized</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2010/2010428vuln-disclosure-summarized-html/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have an admittedly limited view of the exploit dev world. However, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen devs have very few options: (Please correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Responsible Disclosure&amp;rdquo; =&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct Contact =&amp;gt; depending on the size of the vendor and their view on security, this could result in anything from a simple thanks, a reward, to a court hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploit Broker =&amp;gt; possibly sell, possibly not, depends on the broker. The vuln could die on the table or stolen due to too much information being given during negotiations. This route has the same financial risk as direct contact, but a lot less risk of getting sued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZDI (or other vuln clearing house) =&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;instant&amp;rdquo; cash, but admittedly less than an Exploit Broker could possible get based on the financial risk to ZDI. Close to zero risk of court time (they may come after you for selling the exploit). And a lot less financial risk since (IIRC) they pay up front. But then the vulns go to also undisclosed parties, potentially the highest bidder which is probably not the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; secretive groups who share vulns for different reasons&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to friends =&amp;gt; No cash, no judicial risk, but you do risk them stealing/selling your exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Full Disclosure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting it to the web for all to see/user =&amp;gt; Possible court time, but the definite upside is the vendor is forced to react. A very quick way to make enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Releasing at a conference =&amp;gt; Probable court time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No Disclosure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping it to yourself =&amp;gt; Working under the assumption that your the only one that has found that same bug is still semi relevant due to the incredibly small size of the exploit dev community. However, as Dave said, they&amp;rsquo;ll be toasting to their sleeping dead 0days some day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No More Free Bugs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My stance on this is split, while I think people should get paid for their work, I relate this movement to mowing someone&amp;rsquo;s lawn and then ringing their doorbell and asking for money. However I&amp;rsquo;m sure Robert Graham&amp;rsquo;s punch in the face metaphor also works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, I have stated above, I am far and away a newbie to the vuln disclosure world and this debate has been going on since before I owned my own computer, but with the brilliant minds working at it, why doesn&amp;rsquo;t anyone offer up a solid solution to it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution? Create a standard, something that we all abide by. I know as hackers we rebel against such things but in the interest of getting better security out there (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s what we are here for right?&amp;hellip;. right?) we should should really work together on this. What sounds right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, what is the right way to approach someone who&amp;rsquo;s lawn you&amp;rsquo;ve mowed for the work you have done? Maybe free for open source projects, and a price based on exploitability and market share of the affected product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Security (CAN BE) an ART not a SCIENCE</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2010/2010126security-can-be-an-art-not-a-science-html/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is far from a new idea, however it&amp;rsquo;s not something that is easily provable. So I had an idea this morning. I posed the following question on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[](&lt;a href=&#34;http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd3984/1264517021049/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd3985/1264517021667/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-&#34;&gt;http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd3984/1264517021049/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd3985/1264517021667/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what I got in return? a resounding &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; from everyone. (well I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/falconsview/status/8235524239&#34;&gt;one outlier&lt;/a&gt; but, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t when you are trying to apply science to prove art) I challenge you to name another non-artistic career that people are so passionate about that they would stay in it even if they won the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few that I would like to highlight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/schuetzdj&#34;&gt;@schuetzdj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/dookie2000ca&#34;&gt;@dookie2000ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[](&lt;a href=&#34;http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd398c/1264517022533/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd398d/1264517022653/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-&#34;&gt;http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd398c/1264517022533/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd398d/1264517022653/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a somewhat surprising outcome. See a trend? Most people wanted to quit their jobs, and start their own infosec company. Why is this? Is it just &amp;ldquo;The American Dream&amp;rdquo; or is it because they are unhappy with the current people in leadership? Or is it simply the fact that they are hindered from actually pursuing and learning hacking/security at work? The world may never know, but I do implore firms to look at the retention rate of their &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; talent. (No, I don&amp;rsquo;t buy into the No Infosec Peep left behind bull).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a rumor that Google has a practice. 2 hours a day, you (an employee of Google) are REQUIRED to work on a project of your own, that is in no way indebted or owned by Google, even after completion. I can imagine the above answers would change if that were the case where they worked. If their employers fostered learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of Infosec / Hacking being an art, do we have our premadonas? Of course. But do we also have our Van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s and Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s? Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, time for a bit of a reality check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/daveshackleford&#34;&gt;@daveshackleford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[](&lt;a href=&#34;http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd398e/1264517022081/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd398f/1264517022953/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-&#34;&gt;http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd398e/1264517022081/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-.com/static/5005c01d24ac90096800bd6a/51cff728e4b0b79cd4cd31cb/51cff72ae4b0b79cd4cd398f/1264517022953/WindowsLiveWriter-SecurityCANBEanARTnotaSCIENCE_88C3-&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ya, you have NO idea what you would really do with millions of instant cash. I think the number is some 80% of lottery winners go BANKRUPT in the first 10 years. This is because you, and EVERYONE you have ANY connection to, goes absolutely crazy. To the point that there are lottery winner support groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that people say it now, shows that they at least have the passion for the art. (or are just fronting)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some &lt;strong&gt;honest&lt;/strong&gt; answers to even out the tide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I believe that hacking is a science, until passion adds the artistic fire to the mix. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what I think, draw your own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That&amp;rsquo;s another thing I love about this field, you are constantly challenged to draw your own conclusions, to think, to learn, to improve, to be… better)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently on the grmn00bs podcast, I had a great time, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see who they pick up next on their series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grmn00bs.com/2009/12/16/podcast-episode-9-when-they-were-n00bs-with-rob-fullermubix&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grmn00bs podcast: episode 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;When they were n00bs Series&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5.org/&#34;&gt;hak5&lt;/a&gt; is one of the original security shows. Rob has been featured on several segments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://twit.tv/&#34;&gt;Twit Netcast Network with Leo Laporte&lt;/a&gt; is another show that&amp;rsquo;s been around for a while.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.securitytube.net/&#34;&gt;Security Tube&lt;/a&gt; is the Youtube of security videos. This is where I&amp;rsquo;m at when I should be working. You might even find some GRM n00bs stuff rattling around there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theacademypro.com/&#34;&gt;The Academy Pro&lt;/a&gt; is another excellent place to go for security training.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.milw0rm.com&#34;&gt;milw0rm&lt;/a&gt; has lots of exploits. It&amp;rsquo;s a good place to check out some old papers to brush up on security history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://neworder.box.sk/&#34;&gt;NewOrder&lt;/a&gt; is another resource to get abreast of lessons learned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digininja.org/jasager/&#34;&gt;Jasager&lt;/a&gt; is the &amp;ldquo;Yes Man&amp;rdquo; Rob talks about in the show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://astore.amazon.com/carnal0wnage-20/&#34;&gt;Chris Gates&amp;rsquo;s book list&lt;/a&gt; has some good ideas for security reading.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.syngress.com/&#34;&gt;Syngress&lt;/a&gt; is a publisher of security texts. They have all my money.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed, LinkedIn has started allowing you to link your Twitter account to your LinkedIn account. So, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this (since I opted out), but apparently LinkedIn will kick your status updates to Twitter&amp;hellip; like when you get a new job&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy settings out the window! Woohoo for Web 2.0!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop blaming the admins!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/20091118stop-blaming-the-admins-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 04:00:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/20091118stop-blaming-the-admins-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We (the security community) all know, and make fun of &amp;ldquo;Users&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Admins&amp;rdquo;. They are derogatory terms in our community. So much so, that they could almost be classified at curse words. (I can see the XKCD now: Security stick figure talking to IT stick figure. &amp;ldquo;You stupid A****&amp;ldquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I neither discount their &amp;ldquo;contribution&amp;rdquo; to making my day fun, I feel that a lot of people miss an even bigger threat: Policies and Procedures, or SOP (Standard Operating Procedures). Those words are virtual kryptonite to anyone in IT, more so to &amp;lsquo;security professionals&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what makes them a threat? Two thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone hates them so they are rarely updated (you know.. like Windows.. stay with me)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since they are rarely updated, and sometimes even those that are, are written poorly, or actually create vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example lets make all the local admin passwords something really difficult and long, and… all the same so that we can easily administer every machine. This makes it to updates go smoothly and group policy… Oh wait… we don&amp;rsquo;t have those problems anymore (or at least they aren&amp;rsquo;t based on local authentication issues).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, policies and documented procedures are good things. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying they aren&amp;rsquo;t. What I am saying is that when those documented procedures and policies that we blindly follow because the guy that trained me said so, just doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admins: Challenge that policy, find out the reason why you do what they want you to do. The worst that could happen is you could learn something new. The best is that you could change your company&amp;rsquo;s security posture for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security Pros: Time to get off your A**** and update the wiki! (or the doc/site/binder) so that your predecessor, or someone new to your team can hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also challenge you to look at internet policies/procedures… oh wait.. they call those features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simplicity is Security</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/2009813simplicity-is-security-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2009 15:30:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/2009813simplicity-is-security-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Per the best of the best in presenting, what breeds a good presentation slide deck? Simplicity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to pose a statement. &amp;ldquo;Simplicity is Security&amp;rdquo;. The reason I say this is that this day in age, at least in the US, &amp;lsquo;convenience&amp;rsquo; is king. And we try to protect those conveniences with &amp;lsquo;security&amp;rsquo;. Let me start over a bit, this train of thought all started when I started to explain the insecurities in WiMAX to my wife. We saw a WiMAX device that plugged straight into your computer. I told her this was bad because by connecting to this you have no barrier between you and the &amp;lsquo;bad guys&amp;rsquo; other than possibly the Windows Firewall. Her answer surprised me. &amp;lsquo;So?&amp;rsquo; is all she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan doesn&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;lsquo;Check Cards&amp;rsquo; or even really credit cards for that matter. To get such a card you need to go through a book worth of paper work, so it&amp;rsquo;s just not &amp;lsquo;convenient&amp;rsquo; for most people, so they don&amp;rsquo;t get them. So guess what? They don&amp;rsquo;t bank online, and they don&amp;rsquo;t buy stuff online. I racked my brain to figure out what possibly could be on her computer that a &amp;lsquo;bad guy&amp;rsquo; would want. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything (maybe you can). The government relies on paper backups of anything electronic (so they hardly make electronic versions). Signatures are based on stamps that are difficult to copy. The worst a hacker could do on her computer is use it as a zombie, and even then, their ISPs detect and disconnect excessive use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did we as &amp;ldquo;Security Professionals&amp;rdquo; go wrong? Was it the fat paychecks we wanted? Was it the fear of the &amp;lsquo;underground&amp;rsquo;? Reality seems to dictate that we will continue on this path from the analog to the digital, from paper and clerks to networks and AI. The question I want to ask you though is; Should we continue down the path of &amp;ldquo;MORE SECURITY&amp;rdquo; or should we deviate a bit for simpler, possibly non-technical practices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these last two posts you may assume that I favor the Japanese culture and way of life over a US one. You would be mistaken, I simply learn, take the best parts of what I learn, and try to apply them where I can. Learning from others triumphs and defeats, strengths and weaknesses is a basic human function that we a humanoids should embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applied Network Security Density</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/2009812applied-network-security-density-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2009 15:30:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/2009812applied-network-security-density-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently visited Tokyo, Japan. Just as always, my curiosity got the best of me and I started to calculate the population density of the buildings where I was staying. Giving fudge factor of non-populated apartments, I estimated 8,500 families in twelve 15 story buildings, living in a 1.5 mile square piece of land.That&amp;rsquo;s CRAZY. Mass transit and unrestricted modes of transit are not a whim, they are a requirement. I bet you&amp;rsquo;re asking how this applies to security, or for that matter computers at all. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t. But one of it&amp;rsquo;s effects does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an effect of this density, the Mom &amp;amp; Pap stores businesses flourish. In it&amp;rsquo;s density, the &amp;ldquo;big iron&amp;rdquo; is just too inconvenient, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. I used the reference for a reason. It was my own mental bridge between the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; and security world (anyone who denies the difference is confused, and/or just left DefCon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the &amp;ldquo;Big Iron&amp;rdquo; in the security world? Central management, Correlation, and other ways of supposedly spending &amp;ldquo;less&amp;rdquo; on security by having less points of failure. So this is where I stray from the path. I think that networks need to mimic their worldly equivalent. Large organizations need to take an page from Tokyo and decentralize. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s hard getting &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; people, and trust is not something we easily come by in this industry, but from an offensive point of view, centralization just means a bigger payoff. Higher walls, maybe, but an &amp;lsquo;easier&amp;rsquo; target to zero in on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? I eluded to it a bit in my previous paragraph, but what it means is more hands on. We need to train the &amp;lsquo;security guards&amp;rsquo; of our network and put them at every location we have a grouping of nodes. The smaller the grouping of nodes the better. VLANs are not enough. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the the dreaded &amp;ldquo;Defense in Depth&amp;rdquo; phrase: We need to make our defense in depth smaller, more compact. Make it to the point where you don&amp;rsquo;t NEED &amp;ldquo;Big Iron&amp;rdquo; because you have such small perimeters that open source stuff on an old *nix box would work just fine. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an exaggeration but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every city is different and unique, as is any network, and I am by no means saying that decentralization is for everyone. What I do think is that big organizations are getting too hung up on devices and one stop shops where they can set up a NOC and expect a number, however many, of people to be able to watch everything going on. Exactly the way that corporations lose touch with their employees because of their size, they are loosing touch with their network and how it works. How many places have you worked that they have a good diagram of nodes (not just subnets) on their network? Much less documentation on those nodes. How exactly are you supposed to centrally monitor something you have very little knowledge of? Will it take as many years as it did with personnel to reconnect with the life of the network? Probably, but I hope not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I am open to debate and hearing about flaws in my logic, so please leave a comment and tell me what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sexism and the religion of hackers</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/2009713sexism-and-the-religion-of-hackers-html/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Let me preempt this post with the following facts: I am a white male veteran with amazing parents. I went to a good school, and was never under-valued by the people I cared about. I fit no minority profiles in other words. I tell you this so that you can latch on to it as why I don&amp;rsquo;t understand anything in your rebuttal. But I think this gives me a unique view on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People are stupid. They will believe a lie because they want to believe it&amp;rsquo;s true, or because they are afraid it might be true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;-Wizard&amp;rsquo;s First Rule - By Terry Goodkind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post was a long time coming. I feel pretty passionate about &amp;ldquo;my community&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t say that in a lead-follower sense, but more of a Kum Ba Ya one. The feather that pushed this post over the edge into existence is @&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/shazzzam&#34;&gt;shazzzam&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://demosthenes.tumblr.com/post/140922392/female-stereotyping-in-security-research&#34;&gt;Female stereotyping in security research&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which was in response to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackerschool.org/DefconCTF/17/B300.html&#34;&gt;Saphead&amp;rsquo;s Binary 300 solution cartoon&lt;/a&gt;. But please keep in mind, this only set the cogs in motion for this post that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about way before this cartoon came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sexism, and for that matter, any &amp;ldquo;-ism&amp;rdquo; is flawed on both sides. Now, Shazzzam went no where near the extreme that most of the &amp;ldquo;-ists&amp;rdquo; do for their &amp;ldquo;-isms&amp;rdquo;, she actually had some great points however, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t excuse the presumptions she made. Pusscat, Hypatia, and Shazzzam (+ the many other women in IT) have made enormous contributions, just as males have. Hackers are hackers. The only thing we measure by is the brain in your noggin, but I&amp;rsquo;ll go into that later. Where Shazzzam went wrong is that she assumed that this cartoon was depicting the female falsely, which may or may have not been the case. She then used it as a soap box to express her hate for people who make presumptions about her mental abilities because of her sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Damn men, &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; are always assuming I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between a WM (woman-Marine) and a hooker? Hooker gets paid in the morning and the WM gets paid on the 1st and 15th.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;-old Marine joke, origin unknown&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a crude joke, it illustrates a point. During my time in the Marine Corps I witnessed female Marines that were useless, ones that slept around, and those that outshined their peers, male and female alike. But guess what, those that did well were sadly the minority in my experiences. Now you might hinge your argument on that it&amp;rsquo;s my biased opinion that &amp;lsquo;saw&amp;rsquo; what I wanted to see, and you very well could be right. I hardly consider myself perfect, but lets just say for the sake of argument that what I say is true. We all make assumptions, you are not perfect either, is it so wrong to bet on odds or experience when making assumptions? It&amp;rsquo;s human nature, but keeping an open mind is the key to this. How many Mark Dowds, HDs, Shazzzams and Pusscats are there in this world? How many times have you complained about an idiot boss or co-worker? How many times have you complained about script kiddies? or whatever you complain about on an assumption or amassed experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Stupid woman, &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; never do anything right, can&amp;rsquo;t even drive straight)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to my favorite part, and why I love our community. Hackers are hackers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;snip&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=7&amp;amp;id=3&amp;amp;mode=txt&#34;&gt;original - phrak&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(or sexual)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; bias&amp;hellip; and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it&amp;rsquo;s for our own good, yet we&amp;rsquo;re the criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can&amp;rsquo;t stop us all&amp;hellip; after all, we&amp;rsquo;re all alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+++The Mentor+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty of adding &amp;ldquo;(or sexual)&amp;rdquo; to this famous manifesto. But I think it stays in the spirit of it&amp;rsquo;s writer&amp;rsquo;s intent. This is my religion. I think all &amp;ldquo;ists&amp;rdquo; have forgotten what they fight for and just fight to be right. My suggestion? Make a mental note of those who have forgotten how to truly be what they claim as a title. For they will out themselves time and time again, and be destined to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Damn kids. They&amp;rsquo;re all alike.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ethics of Teaching Hacking</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/2009311the-ethics-of-teaching-hacking-html/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2009 14:19:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/2009311the-ethics-of-teaching-hacking-html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My recent post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/archives/456-ozymandns-tunneling-ssh-over-dns.html&#34;&gt;OzymanDNS - Tunneling SSH over DNS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; caused a good friend, and someone I highly respect in the information security field, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/davehull&#34;&gt;Dave Hull&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://trustedsignal.com/&#34;&gt;Trusted Signal&lt;/a&gt;, to call me out on the ethics of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of lying to you, Dave, and to myself, I did not put any thought into the ethics of the post until Dave brought it up. Well, except for that auto subconscious RIGHT/WRONG check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have done a lot of thinking on it since Dave&amp;rsquo;s message to me, I came up with a number of reasons why the post is not unethical and a number of reasons why it was. So I am going to post my thoughts and would like to know what you think. I hardly think there is or ever will be a solid white line of ethics but lets see if we can discuss it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching people to do anything, is at it&amp;rsquo;s core, simply that. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them do it. The flip side of this coin will be in the unethical side so don&amp;rsquo;t get your Anti-NRA panties in a bunch yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://offensive-security.com/&#34;&gt;Offensive Security&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sans.org/&#34;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt;, C|EH (&lt;em&gt;no they don&amp;rsquo;t teach ethics even though it&amp;rsquo;s in the name of the cert&lt;/em&gt;), and all the other &amp;ldquo;Penetration Testing&amp;rdquo; courses are teaching hacking. The phrase &amp;ldquo;Penetration Testing&amp;rdquo; was created so that we could pass it off to our bosses as a needed service without scaring them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unethical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically in the post it is targeting Hotspots that charge money. Skirting this is illegal, and could land some jail time, or at least make you spend some time in airport holding, making you miss your flight. I did not put a disclaimer in the post, and I probably should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hak5 has a huge following of impressionable teens, who may or may not be mature enough to handle this information in the correct manor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, was the post unethical because it sounds like I put my stamp of approval on illegal activities? Would it have been more ethical with a disclaimer? Would have been more ethical without the targeting of hotspots? Should I take the post down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My decision after considering everything? To leave it up, while adding a disclaimer. It is not my job to raise the worlds kids with a solid basis of ethics, but it is my responsibility not to endorse illegal activity to those who follow my activity online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Dave, I look forward to your comments, and anyone else&amp;rsquo;s who would like to chime in on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
