      <description>pfSenseÂ is an excellent free way of including a firewall / ids / proxy in your lab or VMs. It runs small and fast, but even as simple as pfsense is sometimes you need a bit less complexity and speed of configuration.
Enter Peerblock and AnalogX&amp;rsquo;s proxy. Two free tools, one usually used to stop people who torrent from getting caught by the RIAA/MPAA and the other a drop dead simple windows based proxy utility.</description>

      <description>Update 1: No this doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be in memory since you control the system but it was a fun challenge
Update 2: The info from the &amp;lsquo;adduser&amp;rsquo; payload says &amp;lsquo;Create a new user and add them to local administration group&amp;rsquo; - I&amp;rsquo;m guessing since I ran this on a DC is why I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this but it is something to keep in mind when running this script.
Update 3: Here is a powershell way of doing things from a CSV, you can do some passwords in the CSV and keep it for reference too.</description>
