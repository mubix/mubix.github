<p>The team has been criticized a lot by AV vendors, enough so the took down the site in January of this year. But it came back June 5th.</p>
<p>I use this site to help me know when the Incident Responders are on to me for my pen testing jobs. I do not wish to get in the debate of how a tool could be used.</p>
