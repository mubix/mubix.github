    <description><![CDATA[Mimikatz is now built into Metasploit&rsquo;s meterpreter, you can do load mimikatz from the meterpreter prompt, but if you don&rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of dealing with AV, reverse or bind payloads, meterpreter binaries, and you have clear text credentials for an admin, you can just use Mimikatz&rsquo;s alpha release that allows you to run Mimikatz on your machine against a process memory dump of LSASS. The great thing about this technique is that the only thing on disk is a Microsoft tool.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Mimikatz is awesome right, so is WCE. But both have one fatal flaw, even though you can execute them in memory {link} - you still have to have the binaries, remember the command to execute it in memory, and ultimately transfer the entire binary over so that metasploit can do its thing.
Then along came SessionDump. I only noticed this because someone was tweeting congratulations to someone on writing it:]]></description>

(I&rsquo;m not trying to pull some some &ldquo;insert magic here&rdquo; on the assumption of credentials just at the time of this writing I have only just started working (created a blank file) on a post module to do this as your current user, so until then, you need credentials)]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Dave Kennedy and Kevin Mitnick submitted the &ldquo;bypassuac&rdquo; post module to Metasploit a while back (last DerbyCon?). Which is awesome and they did some fantastic work, but I had a few complaints as probably anyone did who used the module on a somewhat modern network.
&ldquo;Old&rdquo; module post/windows/escalate/bypassuac:
I decided to give it a bit of a face lift:
&ldquo;New&rdquo; local exploit module exploit/windows/local/bypassuac:
All of the credit for the availability of this module goes to @egyp7 though, without his epic addition of local exploits to Metasploit the majority of the updates to this module wouldn&rsquo;t be possible.]]></description>

A straight forward way, and provided by Microsoft to create a process as a user (whereby having their token readily available is using &lsquo;runas.exe&rsquo;:

I promised this one a while ago, sorry for the delay. This only does TCP, it&rsquo;d be trivial to do UDP as well but never really found anything interesting and actively going on on the UDP side. It&rsquo;s real simple, first we&rsquo;ve gotta add the GetTcpTable function to railgun:
1 2 3 4 5 session.railgun.add_function(&#39;iphlpapi&#39;, &#39;GetTcpTable&#39;, &#39;DWORD&#39;, [ [&#39;PBLOB&#39;, &#39;pTcpTable&#39;, &#39;out&#39;], [&#39;PDWORD&#39;, &#39;pdwSize&#39;, &#39;inout&#39;], [&#39;BOOL&#39;, &#39;bOrder&#39;, &#39;in&#39;] ]) Then gauge the size of the table:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[A number of times during tests I&rsquo;ve actually run into those mythical creatures called &ldquo;patched windows machines&rdquo;. At DerbyCon Chris Gates and I released the &ldquo;Ask&rdquo; post module (which I had failed to publish). This module very simply uses the ShellExecute windows function via Railgun with the undocumented (but very well known) operator of &lsquo;runas&rsquo;. These two lines accomplished that:
client.railgun.add_function( 'shell32', 'ShellExecuteA', 'DWORD',[[&quot;DWORD&quot;,&quot;hwnd&quot;,&quot;in&quot;],[&quot;PCHAR&quot;,&quot;lpOperation&quot;,&quot;in&quot;],[&quot;PCHAR&quot;,&quot;lpFile&quot;,&quot;in&quot;],[&quot;PCHAR&quot;,&quot;lpParameters&quot;,&quot;in&quot;],[&quot;PCHAR&quot;,&quot;lpDirectory&quot;,&quot;in&quot;],[&quot;DWORD&quot;,&quot;nShowCmd&quot;,&quot;in&quot;],]) client.railgun.shell32.ShellExecuteA(nil,&quot;runas&quot;,&quot;evil.exe&quot;,nil,nil,5) This would quite simply prompt the user with that annoying UAC prompt asking the user to run &rsquo;evil.]]></description>

It looked like a lot of hard work to set that up and I&rsquo;m really lazy. I didn&rsquo;t want to have to go through all that every time I got onto a new network. So, I made a very simple meterpreter post module to just call a Windows API key called &lsquo;gethostbyaddr&rsquo; using Railgun.

    <description><![CDATA[Just a follow up to my previous post. One of the things that sets that method apart is the fact that the suspension (once the DLL injection occurs) comes from within the process, and it suspends all the child processes as well.
Another way you can do this without the injection is just sending a suspend to all the threads in the process.
