  <h1>Finding Admin Access</h1>
  <h2></h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <p>You&rsquo;ve got shell, and a set of credentials but you&rsquo;re coming up empty on what you can do with those credentials. This is especially problematic when you can&rsquo;t get past UAC as you are either in a AlwaysNotify situation or not a local admin.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m not trying to pull some some &ldquo;insert magic here&rdquo; on the assumption of credentials just at the time of this writing I have only just started working (created a blank file) on a post module to do this as your current user, so until then, you need credentials)</p>

<p>Enter the auxiliary module:  <strong>auxiliary/admin/smb/check_dir_file</strong></p>

<p>First we set up a route as aux modules don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;SESSION&rdquo; parameter:</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_49.png" alt="Capture 49" /></p>

<p>Use the module and set our credentials:</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_50.png" alt="Capture 50" /></p>

<p>Next, set ADMIN$ as we can&rsquo;t guarantee C$ is the primary drive, but ADMIN$ will definitely be the WINDOWS directory. Our RHOSTS is our target range</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_51.png" alt="Capture 51" /></p>

<p>A simple &lsquo;run&rsquo; and away it goes:</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_52.png" alt="Capture 52" /></p>

<p>So we can see that our lowly user that doesn&rsquo;t have any chance of bypassing the UAC on his current system can pivot to these other systems (172.16.10.10, and 172.16.10.150) quite easily.</p>

<p>=============================================================================</p>

<p>The rest of this has nothing to do about admin access, just some tricks to do it better</p>

<p>=============================================================================</p>

<p>As many of you know I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of sending packets I don&rsquo;t need to so instead of just spraying a range (which I doubt would be seen, but why take the chance?)</p>

<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: While computer_browser_discovery does lookup all the hosts and sends -more- packets than check_dir_file would, those extra packets are sent at DNS resolvers not into empty space that can be detected by network sensors]</p>

<p>Enter computer_browser_discovery:</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_53.png" alt="Capture 53" /></p>

<p>This module does the equivalent of &lsquo;net view&rsquo; to get a list of computers on the domain. You can change the LTYPE to &ldquo;SQL&rdquo; to just get MSSQL boxes but we&rsquo;re going for everything:</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_54.png" alt="Capture 54" /></p>

<p>As you can see WIN7X86 (the box we are on came up with 0.0.0.0) expected. and the .150 address didn&rsquo;t show up at all as it&rsquo;s not on the domain. So the benefits is that it&rsquo;s quieter on the wire and you probably will find hosts that aren&rsquo;t in your immediate IP range. (Not the case here simply because I don&rsquo;t have a big enough test network). The disadvantages are as with the .150 address you may miss hosts.</p>

<p>Next we add the found host&rsquo;s IP addresses to a text file (targethosts.txt)</p>

<p>[because at the time of this writing the computer_browser_discovery module doesn&rsquo;t add the hosts to the MSF database]</p>

<p>Then use the smb_version module which does a couple things, it verifies that the hosts are there and alive, adds them to the MSF database, and what version of Windows (or samba) they are running:</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_55.png" alt="Capture 55" /></p>

<p>(We still have our route set up so this is module is going through our low privilege user still)</p>

<p>And now we have info in the DB for better targeting:</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_56.png" alt="Capture 56" /></p>

<p>Then back in our check_dir_file module we just use the hosts -R to have the database automatically set RHOSTS to the hosts in the database that match your search or alternatively use services -p 445 -R to add all the hosts that you&rsquo;ve found port 445 open (everything smb_version finds will be shown in services)</p>

<p>One more way you can get hosts is doing reverse lookups of ranges. You can just hit a range you know of, or guess ranges based on the computer_browser_discovery results. You can do this with resolve_ip module (this can be pretty slow on ranges that don&rsquo;t have many hosts):</p>

<p><img src="http://mubix.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/capture_58.png" alt="Capture 58" /></p>

<p>I used the range this blog is hosted on 1) because for some reason my stupid VM wasn&rsquo;t resolving internal stuff 2) To demonstrate that you can use the module to resolve anything, not just internal ranges.</p>

<p>So to wrap up, we have a ton of ways to find hosts that don&rsquo;t involve traditional scanning (smb_version is the only thing that comes close). And we&rsquo;ve located two hosts that we have the ability to administer. One oddly enough being the domain controller, so don&rsquo;t ever discount the access you already have. Tunnel vision is the pentesters worst enemy.</p>
