    <description><![CDATA[Part 2, we have the NTDS.dit file and the SYSTEM.hive file. First we need a few tools:

    <description><![CDATA[This and part 2 are mostly just an update to http://pauldotcom.com/2011/11/safely-dumping-hashes-from-liv.html but without the need for VSSOwn, that and we are doing it remotely without the need for shell on the DC.
Ever run into a Domain Controller that wasn&rsquo;t allowed to talk to the Internet, had insane AV and GPOs not allowing anyone to RDP in (Even Domain Admins) unless they provided some kind of voodo happy dance? Ya me neither, but here is how you can still dump domain hashes and hash history if you run into that case.]]></description>

    <title>Length Sorting Wordlists</title>

    <description><![CDATA[This is one of those stupid simple things that are easy to forget so I&rsquo;m posting it here. Wordlists and dictionaries are awesome for cracking password hashes, and although, thanks to things like Mimikatz and WCE I don&rsquo;t have to, but there is times where it&rsquo;s important.
Now, having John, Hashcat, or Cain go through a dictionary is a 1-for-1 hit, no time wasted no matter how it&rsquo;s sorted and usually is best to sort them by most common first so you get earlier hits.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I made a slide deck to kind of explain my latest project. Basically I got fed up with having dictionaries, passwords, and cracking tools but no way to really do better collaboration in a team format as well as just better management for myself.Â Please feel free to submit pull requests, issues if you think something is broken or want features, or whatever on the Github repo here:

    <description><![CDATA[Since I didn&rsquo;t see any documentation bringing how to take an LM hash that you&rsquo;ve cracked and convert it to the NTLM equivalent all in one place. And I google how to do it almost every time. I wanted to put all these links in one place and remember how to do it for john. Go-go-gadget blog-notes.
So there is this: https://github.com/snarez/rcracki/blob/master/lm2ntlm.cpp
And this: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/lm2ntcrack.rb
And this: http://www.securityfocus.com/tools/6696

    <title>Multiple Dictionaries or Wordlists Using John the Ripper</title>

    <description><![CDATA[John the ripper only takes one word list at a time. There are plenty of docs out there that show you how to cat all of your dictionaries into John&rsquo;s stdin function but I like to run rules against my lists and I didn&rsquo;t see any how-tos on doing this. Here is my way:
ls dicts | xargs -t -I file ./john --pot=victim.pot --format=mscash --wordlist=dicts/file --rules victim_cachedump.txt
This command will ls the &lsquo;dicts&rsquo; directory, pipe it to xargs, which will spit out the command it uses for each itteration (-t) and replace every time it see the word file with the line/itteration its on (-I).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;ve been cracking passwords for a while and use a myriad of tools in a certain order to get the job done. I find that Cain is still my Go-to for allowing me to visualize the process and do some basic sorting (really wish I could search in-app). But I&rsquo;ve been asking around on twitter some questions like Why is GPU cracking for 50k hashes faster than Rainbow Tables (most say the bottleneck is the HDD read style and speed) and many asked what all of my compalints are so I figured this would be the best place (vice multiple emails)]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[When trying to dump password hashes on a Windows 2008 R2 64 bit box I constantly run into the &ldquo;The parameter is incorrect&rdquo; error in meterpreter. So I&rsquo;ve had to fall back on dropping binaries which I really don&rsquo;t like doing because of the added clean up and chance of getting &lsquo;caught&rsquo;. Well, with a bit of migration you&rsquo;ll be back to passing the hash. Here is how, with a bit of the thought process first:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Brute force, even though it&rsquo;s gotten so fast, is still a long way away from cracking long complex passwords. That&rsquo;s were word lists come in handy. It&rsquo;s usually the crackers first go-to solution, slam a word list against the hash, if that doesn&rsquo;t work, try rainbow tables (if they happen to have the tables for that specific hash type), and then the full on brute force. Some would say those first two steps are reversed, and it really is the choice of the the person doing it and the word lists they have to work with.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I recently upgraded my video card and had a rough time finding programs that fit the hype of GPU password cracking, so here is what I found so that you won&rsquo;t have as hard a time.
