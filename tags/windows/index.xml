      <description>Ever have one of those topics that you know you&amp;rsquo;ve looked up 100 times but never can remember the answer?
I was having one of those moments in a recent conversation on the NoVA Hackers mailing list (If you want to join please read the instructions before requesting to join)
The question came up as to what effect &amp;ldquo;Password Required: No&amp;rdquo; means in a net user UserName is.
As usual, MSDN isn&amp;rsquo;t very helpful:</description>

      <title>SMB/HTTP Auth Capture via SCF File</title>

      <description>Recently saw a link to an SCF file. Didn&amp;rsquo;t know what those were so I went digging. Turns out they are a simple text based file that controls Windows Explorer. ;-)
Here are the examples I found via the references:
Open Explorer
[Shell] Command = 2 IconFile = explorer.exe, 1 [Taskbar] Command = Explorer  Open &amp;ldquo;Channels&amp;rdquo; page in IE:
[Shell] Command=3 IconFile=shdocvw.dll,-118 [IE] Command=Channels  This didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me at all, probably because Internet Explorer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;Channels&amp;rdquo; anymore.</description>

      <description>One of the best resources for persistence mechanisms is Hexacorn&amp;rsquo;s blog. http://www.hexacorn.com/blog/category/autostart-persistence/
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked out his &amp;ldquo;Beyond good ol&amp;rsquo; Run key&amp;rdquo; (linked above) 32 post series, you really should. But today I wanted to talk about one that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see up there:
DNVM (https://github.com/aspnet/dnvm) is the DotNet Version Manager and it&amp;rsquo;s a part of ASP.NET 5, which I believe has been inside of Visual Studio since the 2013 version.</description>

      <description>One of the problems with using PSEXEC from Metasploit (any of the psexec modules) is that it runs as SYSTEM. What&amp;rsquo;s the problem with that? Isn&amp;rsquo;t SYSTEM god mode? Ya, and normally I&amp;rsquo;d agree that it&amp;rsquo;s the best level to have, but the defenses these days have gotten better, and getting direct connections out is pretty rare. That leaves proxies, and as you know SYSTEM doesn&amp;rsquo;t get any proxy settings.</description>
