    <guid>https://malicious.link/posts/2018/getting-hired-a-few-tips/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[In early August of 2017 I posted a few tips to Twitter regarding interviewing and getting hired in general. I&rsquo; pasting them here to preserve them. I only had 140 characters to make these, and I think there is a lot more you can do, but 30 tips is a good start.
Don&rsquo;t post obvious CFAA violations to social media If you go in without a job and a chip on your shoulder, you&rsquo;ll leave the same way If you don&rsquo;t ask follow up questions, I won&rsquo;t have any either, like &ldquo;would you like the job?]]></description>

So I created a very simple Google doc to help put twitter handles and links together for people who are job hunting and people who are hiring to kinda get to know who to talk to.]]></description>
