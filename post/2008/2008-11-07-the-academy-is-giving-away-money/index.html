<p>This month, I thought that it would be fun to partner up with <a href="http://www.hackersforcharity.org/">Hackers for Charity</a> in order to raise money for the people of Uganda. <a href="http://www.theacademy.ca">The Academy</a> has offered to donate $1 to <a href="http://www.hackersforcharity.org/">Hackers for Charity</a> for every user that registers for a free account at <a href="http://www.theacademy.ca">www.theacademy.ca</a> for the entire month of November. If you&rsquo;re a registered user already please forward this email or post it on a blog. Anything you can do to spread the word would be greatly appreciated. Let&rsquo;s try to make a substantial donation to charity this month. Thanks everybody!</p>
<p>So head on over and sign up. It&rsquo;s free and you can feel better about yourself. Plus you can help me in my goal to make The Academy&rsquo;s Director broke.</p>
