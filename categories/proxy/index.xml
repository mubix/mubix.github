      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used proxychains to push things through Meterpreter, one of the most annoying things is its &amp;ldquo;hardcoded&amp;rdquo; DNS setting for 4.2.2.2, if the org that you are going after doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow this out of their network, or if you are trying to resolve an internal asset, you&amp;rsquo;re SOL. After a ton of googling and annoyed head slams into walls every time I forget where this is I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to make a note of it.</description>

      <description>One of the great things about the reverse_http(s) payloads is that it is proxy aware. However one of the pitfalls to this is that SYSTEM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have proxy settings, nor do users who have never logged into a system (unless profile loading is triggered). The problem here arrises when you are trying to do anything as SYSTEM, also the PSEXEC only has the option of getting you a SYSTEM shell (so you&amp;rsquo;re done for right out of the door)</description>

      <description>pfSenseÂ is an excellent free way of including a firewall / ids / proxy in your lab or VMs. It runs small and fast, but even as simple as pfsense is sometimes you need a bit less complexity and speed of configuration.
Enter Peerblock and AnalogX&amp;rsquo;s proxy. Two free tools, one usually used to stop people who torrent from getting caught by the RIAA/MPAA and the other a drop dead simple windows based proxy utility.</description>
