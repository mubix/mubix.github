      <description>First off, this is dead simple and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work, but it does. Also, there is no possible way that I&amp;rsquo;m the first one that has identified this, but here it is (trust me, I tested it so many ways to confirm it because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it was true)
TL;DR USB Ethernet + DHCP + Responder == Creds
Thesis: If I plug in a device that masquerades as a USB Ethernet adapter and has a computer on the other end, can I capture credentials from a system, even when locked out (yes, logged in, just locked).</description>

      <title>Effective NTLM / SMB Relaying</title>

      <description>SMB Relay has been around for a long while. I even have a post about using it along with LNK files here:
MS08-068 + MS10-046 = Fun until 2018
Here is the problem though. Most of the tools to exploit it either catch the authentication in NTLMv2/NTLMv1 (which is not always easy to crack) or assume administrative access (because they attempt to PSEXEC with the incoming session). Well, since MS08-068 thats much harder to pin down.</description>
