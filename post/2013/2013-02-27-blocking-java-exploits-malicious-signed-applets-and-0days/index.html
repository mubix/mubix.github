            <div class="post-content">
                <p>The following has been a concept for me for a long time and recently I tweeted the idea which really put me under the fire to prove it. (re: justanidea hashtag)</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And a few people came up with some very valid points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t work so well with HTTPS sites</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right, but that forces the attack to use SSL, and doing so can yield the defender more information about the attacker, and offer other avenues of defense.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Can&rsquo;t an attack just spoof the user-agent?</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>and a response:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But in actuality that setting is applied inside the Java code, which needs to be requested by Java first. Using it&rsquo;s User-Agent string. There are probably ways to get this done with Java script or other methods of loading the Java classes/jars but I haven&rsquo;t been able to find any.</p>
<p>and finally 3) Whitelisting is a myth!</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Which goes along with phoobar&rsquo;s responses as well:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Yes, there will definitely be challenge when implementing blocking java user agents, and one of the biggest pit falls is that there is no clear indicators to a user that that&rsquo;s the reason for the block. There are ways to make it more evident with custom proxy error pages, but it is a thorn in this solution.</p>
<p>On to the walking of the walk. Oddly enough there is little to no documentation on blocking or even detecting outbound user-agent strings. But I did happen across an excellent post about how to use Squid to block IE (which I&rsquo;m all for! ;-):</p>
<p><a href="http://gaugusch.at/squid.shtml">http://gaugusch.at/squid.shtml</a></p>
<p>The following is just my testing of his walk-through converted to be used to block java:</p>
<p>I used pfSense for my testing since it&rsquo;s very easy to set up and already has Squid as a package:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You get the point.</p>
<p>We set up the latest Java 0day in Metasploit:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Get the user to go to our malicious web site:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And the user doesn&rsquo;t see anything. This can be modified in the module. You also see that I was using &ldquo;Intranet&rdquo; IP space so some IE settings were lower, but nothing that would effect this exploit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And shell! I want to pull your attention to that YWpdDan.jar request though. That request actually is done by Java with the following user-agent:</p>
<p><code>&quot;Mozilla/4.0 (Windows XP 5.1) Java/1.7.0_09&quot;</code></p>
<p>Alright, so the exploit works, but how about the solution? In pfSense you have the ability to slam &ldquo;Custom Options&rdquo; into the bottom of pfSense&rsquo;s Squid config page. Like so:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is probably a better regex for selecting only Java user-agents, but this worked for now, and I don&rsquo;t think any browsers actually use &ldquo;Java&rdquo; in their user-agents. (UPDATE: Searching for &ldquo;site:useragentstring.com java&rdquo; on google only yielded Java, and YACYBOT, which is built on java as using the string &ldquo;Java&rdquo; in their agents)</p>
<p>You can also notice that I&rsquo;ve whitelisted webex.com and java.com sites and subdomains so that my &ldquo;users&rdquo; won&rsquo;t get blocked using the tools on those sites. This could be pretty hefty with (as phoobar said) a Java dev group. But after the initial push and getting a semi &ldquo;required&rdquo; list of external approved sites this list shouldn&rsquo;t need much upgrading, even for large organizations.</p>
<p>Save the config and let&rsquo;s see how this works out:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ok, but did the attacker still get a shell?</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Nope! Win!</p>
<p>Just to prove that HTTPS isn&rsquo;t fixed here lets set those options up in Metasploit and kick the same exploit:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And after an error about a self-signed cert (notice the SSLCert option in Metasploit that has the ability to solve that as well) we get the expected result:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And subsequent shell without any indication in Squid&rsquo;s proxy logs of a Java user-agent:</p>
<p><img src="/images/postimages/201302_blockjava_16.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, sort of a long post but hopefully something that people can use. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I&rsquo;m not exactly certain how this affects Java &ldquo;Web Start&rdquo; weblet exploits if at all.</p>
