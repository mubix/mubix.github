      <description>One should never be made to make a decision such as the one I&amp;rsquo;m about to share with you: Where I work, there are two Male restrooms. One is downstairs, still within &amp;lsquo;hurry&amp;rsquo; distance, and the other is just across the hall. You are probably thinking, &amp;lsquo;Where is the decision in that?&amp;rsquo;. Well this is where it gets interesting. Both are alright for number 1 traffic. No big deal, in and out.</description>
