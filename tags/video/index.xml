      <title>Effective NTLM / SMB Relaying</title>

      <description>SMB Relay has been around for a long while. I even have a post about using it along with LNK files here:
MS08-068 + MS10-046 = Fun until 2018
Here is the problem though. Most of the tools to exploit it either catch the authentication in NTLMv2/NTLMv1 (which is not always easy to crack) or assume administrative access (because they attempt to PSEXEC with the incoming session). Well, since MS08-068 thats much harder to pin down.</description>
