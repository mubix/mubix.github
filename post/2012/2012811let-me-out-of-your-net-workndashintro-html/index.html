  <h1>Let Me Out Of Your .NET work–Intro</h1>

<div class="content">
  <p>Something that is often useful is a known-good. Something out of the control of your adversary or outside modifiers. But back to that in a sec, egress ‘busting’ or getting your payload/backdoor/trojan/c2 out of someone’s network once you’ve gotten that ever elusive “CODE EXECUTION HAPPY DANCE” going on isn’t always easy. There is even a Metasploit payload for it called ‘allports’:</p>

<p><a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2009/09/24/forcing-payloads-through-restrictive-firewalls">https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2009/09/24/forcing-payloads-through-restrictive-firewalls</a></p>

<p>There is also ‘Egress Buster’ by the guys over at TrustedSec which can do 1000 ports in just a few seconds:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.trustedsec.com/july-2012/egress-buster-reverse-bypassav/">https://www.trustedsec.com/july-2012/egress-buster-reverse-bypassav/</a></p>

<p>The problem I find with these tools is that they are still straight TCP. *(Yes, yes I know most networks still allow some ports directly outbound) and these tools are still quite valid. During the span between these two tools being released, MrB released a site that listens on all 65k ports: <a href="http://open.zorinaq.com/about/">http://open.zorinaq.com/about/</a></p>

<p>Figured I should merge these ideas and add a few more capabilities (and show you how I did it so you can do so yourself), and so LetMeOutOfYour.net was born.</p>

<p>You can hit any subdomain or hostname of letmeoutofyour.net on any port with any HTTP Verb for any resource (web page or folder) and you will always receive a ‘w00tw00t’ back.</p>

<p>For example this request (removed the unimportant headers on the request to save space):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>POST /admin/login.php HTTP/1.1<br />
Host: development.letmeoutofyour.net:8081</p>

<p>username=admin&amp;password=password</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will result in this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br />
Date: Sat, 11 Aug 2012 02:21:54 GMT<br />
Server: Apache<br />
Last-Modified: Sat, 11 Aug 2012 02:16:55 GMT<br />
Accept-Ranges: bytes<br />
Content-Length: 9<br />
Vary: Accept-Encoding<br />
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100<br />
Connection: Keep-Alive<br />
Content-Type: text/html</p>
</blockquote>

<p>w00tw00t</p>

<p>All of those headers are standard Apache headers with the content being just ‘w00tw00t’. Making the connection an HTTP one opens a few doors to things like proxies. It’s ok to cackle at this point.</p>

<p>In the following parts I’ll show you how to build the server itself and a binary to find it’s way out of networks. Feel free to point your own domains at the IP it’s hosted on, it can handle it. Have a try, I know you want to:</p>
