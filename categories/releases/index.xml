    <description><![CDATA[Password Filters [0] are a way for organizations and governments to enforce stricter password requirements on Windows Accounts than those available by default in Active Directory Group Policy. It is also fairly documented on how to Install and Register Password Filters [1]. Basically what it boils down to is updating a registry key here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages
with the name of a DLL (without the extension) that you place in Windows\System32\]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[If you follow the exact same steps you did for Netview: /blog/2012/10/07/compiling-and-release-of-netview/
then you already have the steps needed to create a compiled version of ditto from the repo here:
https://github.com/mubix/ditto
And while the sheep icon is cute, and a nod to what ditto does, it comes at a pretty hefty cost:
Size. Now if you&rsquo;re scoffing at 408 KB then you don&rsquo;t have any issues, but I like not having to wait while a binary I am trying to push to a victim box is transferring.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[If you haven&rsquo;t caught Chris Gates (@carnal0wnage) and my talk at DerbyCon 2012 - we released 2 tools, Netview, and Ditto. Here I&rsquo;ll walk you through compiling Netview yourself, in the next blog post we&rsquo;ll go over compiling Ditto and how you can remove it&rsquo;s icon to reduce the size if you want. But for Netview it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward. First you pull a copy of the GIT repository:

    <description><![CDATA[Since it&rsquo;s Christmas and all, I thought I&rsquo;d post the code snippet from my Hak5 segment a bit early:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 #include &lt;Clipboard.au3&gt; #include &lt;File.au3&gt; $oldclip = &#34;&#34; While 1 $clip = _ClipBoard_GetData() If $clip &lt;&gt; &#34;0&#34; Then If $clip &lt;&gt; $oldclip Then _FileWriteLog(@UserProfileDir &amp; &#34;clip.log&#34;, $clip) $oldclip = $clip EndIf EndIf Sleep(100) WEnd It&rsquo;s pretty straight forward, and I welcome everyone to install AutoIt3 and compile/run the above script to see what it does (although most of you I&rsquo;m sure can figure it out just by reading it).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[If you haven’t seen it yet, I posted about a Nerv-Labs Live DVD that included all kinds security distros in one bootable DVD. Which was also featured in Episode 0x415 of Hak5. Well, there were some things that it was kinda lacking, mainly Helix and Samurai.
Well, my buddy Marcus Carey from SunTzu Data did it up right. Let me introduce SumoLinux. SumoLinux has the following linux distributions on it:]]></description>
