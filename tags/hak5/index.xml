      <description>First off, this is dead simple and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work, but it does. Also, there is no possible way that I&amp;rsquo;m the first one that has identified this, but here it is (trust me, I tested it so many ways to confirm it because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it was true)
TL;DR USB Ethernet + DHCP + Responder == Creds
Thesis: If I plug in a device that masquerades as a USB Ethernet adapter and has a computer on the other end, can I capture credentials from a system, even when locked out (yes, logged in, just locked).</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard already about Jasager.. well you probably don&amp;rsquo;t read this blog, but for those who want to know a bit more about the history of Jasager - Karma on the Fon, where the project is now, and where it&amp;rsquo;s headed, then buckle up, and hang on while we first travel down memory lane.
History: The time was ShmooCon 2006. It was my very first &amp;ldquo;HACKER&amp;rdquo; convention. I was there with my buddies from Hak5 and SploitCast.</description>
