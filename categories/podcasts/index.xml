    <description><![CDATA[So, I haven’t posted in a while. Which is due to supreme work related stresses&hellip;. no, actually just lazyness, but atleast I am a bit better than say, oh Darren Kitchen, (April 17th) or Wess Tobler (December 11th). Ok, ya, my last post was on the 6th of April and TECHNICALLY I don’t beat Darren’s but, I actually post something, he posts videos&hellip; pfffft. That isn’t a blog. ;-) You know I love you D.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Geez. I never have time anymore to put something on this darn thing. I think I am going to stop apologizing for how long it takes me to post, because it is quite quickly becoming the norm. So anyways, since my last post, I have been to ShmooCon &lsquo;06
I met some great people to include but not limited to, Lance James, Kevin Mitnick, Fyodor - A.K.A the creator of NMAP, Skydog, DC-Mike, and Simple Nomad.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Just a real quick FYI. Since I have been getting more and more into the IPTV scene, I figured that I would add links to my favorite shows. I will most indubitably be adding more, but this is a good start. Check it out over

    <description><![CDATA[December 2nd, I drove down to Williamsburg VA to meet up with the guys from Hak.5 and Frank Linhares. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know. Hak.5 is an IPTV (Vidcast) show, which basically boils down to a TV show on the internet. Anyways, I got to meet up with these fellas and a couple other interesting people. While I was there, I had the privilege of helping out not only in the live techPhile podcast by Frank Linhares, but also the &lsquo;glue&rsquo; segments of Ep 5 of Hak.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Well if you were wondering about me, I didn&rsquo;t die. I am working on a super secret project for Frank Linhares of techPhile.ca
But don&rsquo;t tell anyone! That is secret squrrell news. I have also submitted some logo ideas for the new Auditor Security Collection. You can vote for me: HERE
I also got a HP dv1420us which, so far, I really like. It doesn&rsquo;t like linux too much, but it is challenging me to learn more about the kernel and other aspects of linux to fix the problems.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I am proud to announce that TechTV, the cable television channel that we know and USED to love might just be making a comeback. In an ‘Aliens’ sort of revival, a year and a half after they were pwnd ‘merged’, might be popping out on top of G4. For starters they are bringing back “Call for Help” with Leo Leporte. First seen on KevinRose.com which is a blog written by, yup you guessed it Kevin Rose, the next move is that the G4 Founder and CEO who engineered the dumbass move ‘merger’ has been FIRED!]]></description>
