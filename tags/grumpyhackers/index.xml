    <description><![CDATA[A little history A couple months ago @carnal0wnage, @bsdbandit and @theblindhacker (I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get corrected if I&rsquo;m wrong here) were at NoVAHackers just talking in the parking lot after the event and thought that it would be nice if they didn&rsquo;t have to wait a month to have conversations like they were having each month out in the parking lot after the events. In passing @carnal0wnage told me about this and I set out to make it happen (for selfish reasons, I wanted to talk to them too).]]></description>
