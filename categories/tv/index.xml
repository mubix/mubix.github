      <description>So, I haven’t posted in a while. Which is due to supreme work related stresses&amp;hellip;. no, actually just lazyness, but atleast I am a bit better than say, oh Darren Kitchen, (April 17th) or Wess Tobler (December 11th). Ok, ya, my last post was on the 6th of April and TECHNICALLY I don’t beat Darren’s but, I actually post something, he posts videos&amp;hellip; pfffft. That isn’t a blog. ;-) You know I love you D.</description>

      <description>A leaked image from an upcoming episode of LOST. Could it be that Henry Gale is telling the truth? Or could this just be some sort of flash back?
