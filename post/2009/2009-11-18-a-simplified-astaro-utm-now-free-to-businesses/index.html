            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Disclaimer: I was given a demo license of the new free business product to break/review. No money has traded hands. This is my brutally honest opinion of the product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played with a gambit of Astaro products, and personally I really hate UTMs, just like I do All-In-One Printer/Copier/Faxes. One thing breaks, they all do. However, Astaro&rsquo;s .. before I go into my opinions of the product, or get on any soap box, here are the facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Astaro Security Gateway was free for home use already</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* (works awesome for VM demos)
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>On November 16th 2009, Astaro Security Gateway &ldquo;Essential Firewall Edition&rdquo; is now FREE to any business that wants to run a copy.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* Essential Firewall Edition is basically a enterprise grade firewall w/ VPN and some reporting.
</code></pre>
<p>Why I like this product is not because it&rsquo;s Astaro, but because it&rsquo;s the bare essentials. It&rsquo;s exactly what a small to mid size business needs for you to stop getting calls from your friend at 5 AM asking why the Linksys you put DD-WRT on to be slick is down.</p>
<p>There is no better gift you can give a business as an IT/Security guy, then the ability to see and log. Test it out, you&rsquo;ll be amazed at what you see on your network.</p>
<p>Like I said initially, this is a brutally honest post, and I whole heartedly believe in FREE, and one tool for one job. However so far it&rsquo;s been all fluff and daisies. In coming posts, I&rsquo;ll show how it, and other free alternatives break, or stand up from an attack point of view.</p>
<p>On a site note, it works flawlessly with the iPhone ;-) - Use public wifi with no less fear, when all of your traffic is going through a VPN automagically. That&rsquo;ll make the boss happy.</p>
