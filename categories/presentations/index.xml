His blog is here: http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/
And since a picture is worth a thousand words:

      <description>Since this is a constantly updating slide deck I figured I&amp;rsquo;d post it here so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to keep emailing it out. ;-) If you have comments or if something is wrong grammatically, technically or in any other way I&amp;rsquo;d love input. Suggestions also welcome.
 Here is a link straight to the doc if you want to comment or add it to your google docs list: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pPXLg3KqwSMLRCNRfows5QnVI2mLjSmll5vN2WHMFJg/edit</description>

      <description>Chris Gates (@carnal0wnage) and I will be speaking at DerbyCon next week:
The Dirty Little Secrets They Didn&amp;rsquo;t Teach You In Pentesting Class
&amp;ldquo;This talk is about methodologies and tools that we use or have coded that make our lives and pentest schedule a little easier, and why we do things the way we do. Of course, there will be a healthy dose of Metasploit in the mix. &amp;ldquo;</description>

      <description>First of all, here is my slide deck from DojoSec with a couple added slides, words, and slight modifications:
  From Couch To Career In 80 Hours  from Rob Fuller 
I have put this article off quite a few times due to some very cool and interesting things happening in our field as it applies to getting a job. That, and Matt Johansen beat me to it with his blog post titled: &amp;ldquo;A lot of Information Security Career Advice&amp;rdquo;, which I highly recommend you check out and add to your RSS reader.</description>

      <guid>https://malicious.link/post/2009/2009-05-05-workshop-at-toorcamp-with-dark0perator/</guid>
      <description>Dark0perator and I will be giving a workshop at ToorCamp coming up July 2nd-5th:
You can find us on the ToorCamp site: http://www.toorcamp.org/content/W13
Here is the description of our talk, save the bio(s):
The Art of Pivot and Persistence: Shell is only the beginning.
 This workshop is based on the assumption that you have some level of access on a target system. From that it is demonstrated how to go from that level of access to taking over the whole company and how to keep that access, surviving reboots, AV scans, and even reimaging.</description>

      <description>Today I was in a brief / talk / meeting and I just wanted to share with you some of the things that I saw in this event that might better help you know what NOT to do while getting up in front of any size crowd.
 Death by bullets (Yes this is bulleted to be ironic). But seriously, this was a reoccuring theme throughout the meeting. Try and keep it to 3 or 5.</description>

      <title>Speaking Evolved</title>

      <description>I believe there is a fear in the security community about speaking. Most don’t believe they either have something important enough to say, or have some awesome ‘thing’ and are just too afraid of the stage. Here are some resources and videos that have helped me gain the confidence to speak.

&amp;ndash; Specifically look at how he speaks. How he starts, how he finishes.</description>

      <description>Do what you love, love what you do is what I have been told since I was young, and Gary V takes that puts it in the mirror and makes you look at it with the following video:
