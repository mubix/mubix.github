      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry to get your hopes up, but other people have been waiting for this to happen too&amp;hellip;. Well, a design team was actually formed and got together to build a &amp;ldquo;mod&amp;rdquo; for StarCraft based on the WarCraft 3 engine. Some are calling this StarCraft 2, however Blizzard has refrained from fomally answering any questions about the unofficial mod.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As with any new thing there is always something that goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commentary for the Hak.5 Lanparty has been delayed due to Microsoft Windows being stupid. So everyone say &amp;ldquo;Thank you Bill!&amp;rdquo; and hopefully we will be up and live soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GCA - Mubix&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALL PROBLEMS WERE FIXED. THANKS FOR LISTENING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>America&#39;s Army: Kicking KDE to the Kurb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, yeah you’ve got me. This is old news. But COME ON! Someone needs to send a Marine Drill Instructor over to the Army and woop these guys into shape! The windows version of America’s Army version 2.4 came out May 16th 2005. That is a 127 days (4 months) at the time of this post. Where are the Linux and Mac versions?!?! We are still stuck in version 2.3. They haven’t even release an update so we can at the very least run linux servers! They are loosing a very large user base because of this HUGE gap that is going on. Someone needed to say something. Hopefully they will here my voice. On this forum, no mod can lock me out. I will be patient, because I like the game, but my patience and countless other’s patience is wearing thin. Who knows, Microsoft (aka Bill) could have made a deal with the Army. But who am I to speculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jd&lt;/p&gt;
