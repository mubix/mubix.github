                <p>First of all, here is my slide deck from DojoSec with a couple added slides, words, and slight modifications:</p>

<p>I have put this article off quite a few times due to some very cool and interesting things happening in our field as it applies to getting a job. That, and <a href="http://www.mattjaysecurity.com">Matt Johansen</a> beat me to it with his blog post titled: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mattjaysecurity.com/?p=39">A lot of Information Security Career Advice</a>&quot;, which I highly recommend you check out and add to your RSS reader.  So instead of rewriting things that other people have already covered I'll just post the links to them:</p>
<p>We start our journey as any real hacker would, with the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.rootcompromise.org/hhg/">Hacker Handle Generator</a>&quot;.  And since I am more of an Audio/Visual Leaner  let's start off with &ldquo;<a href="http://exoticliability.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=462895">Exotic Liability Episode 10: Advice</a>&rdquo; Where Ryan Jones, DJ Jackalope, and Chris Nickerson, of &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Team_(TV_series)">Tiger Team</a>&rdquo; fame, fortune and power,  call back Michigan Justin and talk at length about how to start out in the community. We also have Don Donzal from <a href="http://www.ethicalhacker.net">EthicalHacker.net</a> who talks about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/201/24/">DIY Career in Ethical Hacking</a>&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.ethicalhacker.net/images/stories/columns/editor/diycareer/donzal_diycareerinethicalhacking_sanspentestsummit2008.mp3">MP3</a> / <a href="http://www.ethicalhacker.net/images/stories/columns/editor/diycareer/diy%20career%20in%20ethical%20hacking.pdf">SLIDES</a>), and about 16 tips from &ldquo;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jrallis/tips-from-ugly-resumes-get-jobs">Ugly Resumes get Jobs!</a>&rdquo; on Slideshare. But this A/V setup wouldn't be complete if I didn't tell you guys where you can get all kinds of videos actually teaching you security so that you can have a leg up on everyone else. Head on over to <a href="http://www.theacademypro.com/">TheAcademyPro.com</a> where you can watch 1-5 minute videos on everything from configuring Snort and exploiting systems with Metasploit, to configuring Sourcefire 3D and destroying the world with Core Impact. Another site to bookmark is <a href="http://www.securitytube.net/">SecurityTube.net</a>. The guys there work their fingers to the bone to locate security videos across the net and put them all in one central pace for you to access.</p>
<p>Now on for those people who like to do all that &ldquo;reading&rdquo; stuff.  First head on over to the <a href="http://www.securitycatalyst.com/">Security Catalyst</a> for <a href="http://www.securitycatalyst.com/career-advice-for-security-geeks-part-1/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.securitycatalyst.com/career-advice-for-security-geeks-part-2/">Part 2</a> of &ldquo;Career Advice for Security Geeks&rdquo; and Paul Asadoorian's post titled &ldquo;<a href="http://pauldotcom.com/2009/05/getting-started-in-information.html">Getting Started In Information Security How-To</a>&rdquo; and Kees Leune's post titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.leune.org/blog/kees/2008/10/-tips-for-getting-started-1.html">Tips for Getting Started in Information Security</a>&quot;, and if you are really feeling froggy, read all 4+ years (only 6 or so pages don't worry too much) of the discussion on the Defcon forums: &ldquo;<a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=3741&amp;page=1">Getting started in the security field</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, sticking with the theme that I try to keep going on this blog I want to give you something new to digest:</p>
<p>James Arlen (aka myrcurial) does a talk at Notacon about going from <a href="http://vimeo.com/4311958">BlackHat to BlackSuit</a></p>
<p>LifeHacker's &ldquo;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5157794/top-10-tools-for-landing-a-better-job">Top 10 Tools for landing a better job</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aaron Crowe writes about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.walletpop.com/blog/2009/05/16/how-to-avoid-being-scammed-in-a-job-hunt/">How to avoid being scammed in a job hunt</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee Kushner writes about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infosecleaders.com/2009/05/career-advice-wanting-a-job-too-much/">Wanting a Job Too Much</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two Mashable articles: &ldquo;<a href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/13/twitter-jobs/">How to find a Job on Twitter</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://mashable.com/2009/05/19/twtbizcard/">How to exchange Biz cards on Twitter</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I wanted to close with some advice that a lot of people have a hard time with. And that is how to talk dollars, and how to do it well.  And Jack Chapman is certainly the guy to learn from. Check out a write-up on him on <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/">GetRichSlowly.org</a> titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/05/06/negotiating-your-salary-how-to-make-1000-a-minute/">Negotiating Your Salary: How to Make $1,000 a Minute</a>&rdquo; (which is the title of Chapman's book). And <a href="http://salarynegotiations.com/">Chapman's site</a> where he has tons of YouTube videos of tips that he describes in the book.</p>
<p>Sorry this is a bunch of links, and if you guys would like me to explain each slide in my Couch to Career deck I'll make another post about it.</p>
